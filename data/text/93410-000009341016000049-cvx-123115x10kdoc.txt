Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation, * a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-4. As of December 31, 2015 , Chevron had approximately 61,500 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees). Approximately 29,600 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 48 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. Operating Environment Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-8 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook. Chevron’s Strategic Direction Chevron’s primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the company’s strategies are to grow profitably in core areas and build new legacy positions. In the downstream, the strategies are to deliver competitive returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to apply commercial and functional excellence in supply, trading and transportation to enable the success of the upstream and downstream strategies, and to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance. Information about the company is available on the company’s website at www.chevron.com . Information contained on the company’s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the company’s website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . ________________________________________________________ * Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we” and “us” may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. 3 Description of Business and Properties The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects * in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2015 , and assets as of the end of 2015 and 2014 — for the United States and the company’s international geographic areas — are in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-37. Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 15 and 16 on pages FS-40 through FS-41. Refer to page FS-13 of this Form 10-K in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company's capital and exploratory expenditures. Upstream Reserves Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-65 for a tabulation of the company’s proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2013 and each year-end from 2013 through 2015 . Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 , are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations. At December 31, 2015, 21 percent of the company's net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan and 19 percent were located in the United States. The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2013 through 2015 are shown in the following table: * Oil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of oil . ________________________________________________________ 4 Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2015 and 2014 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 2.622 million barrels per day in 2015 was up 2 percent from 2014 . Production increases from project ramp-ups in the United States and Bangladesh and production entitlement effects in several locations were partially offset by the Partitioned Zone shut-in, normal field declines and the effect of asset sales. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2013 through 2015 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas, and refer to Table V on pages FS-68 and FS-69 for information on annual production by geographical region. 5 Production Outlook The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2016 will be flat to 4 percent growth compared to 2015. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, as described beginning on page FS-4. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,” beginning on page 8, for a discussion of the company’s major crude oil and natural gas development projects. Average Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of Production Refer to Table IV on page FS-64 for the company’s average sales price per barrel of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and per thousand cubic feet of natural gas produced, and the average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Gross and Net Productive Wells The following table summarizes gross and net productive wells at year-end 2015 for the company and its affiliates: Acreage At December 31, 2015 , the company owned or had under lease or similar agreements undeveloped and developed crude oil and natural gas properties throughout the world. The geographical distribution of the company’s acreage is shown in the following table: Delivery Commitments The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 160 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties through 2018 . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. 6 Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 1,343 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2016 through 2018 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries. Development Activities Refer to Table I on page FS-61 for details associated with the company’s development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . The following table summarizes the company’s net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the company’s development wells drilling at December 31, 2015 . A “development well” is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. Exploration Activities Refer to Table I on page FS-61 for detail on the company’s exploration expenditures and costs of unproved property acquisitions for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . The following table summarizes the company’s net interests in productive and dry exploratory wells completed in each of the last three years, and the number of exploratory wells drilling at December 31, 2015 . “Exploratory wells” are wells drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in unproved areas and include delineation and appraisal wells, which are wells drilled to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area. 7 Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2015 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page FS-6, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-10. The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the company’s share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. United States Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in California, the Gulf of Mexico, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming. Net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2015 averaged 720,000 barrels per day. In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2015, net daily production averaged 166,000 barrels of crude oil, 61 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). During 2015, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 164,000 barrels of crude oil, 315 million cubic feet of natural gas and 16,000 barrels of NGLs. The company is pursuing selected opportunities for divestment of shelf assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Chevron is also engaged in various exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Total daily production from the Jack and St. Malo fields in 2015 averaged 61,000 barrels of liquids (31,000 net) and 10 million cubic feet of natural gas (5 million net). Production ramp-up and development drilling for the first development phase continued in 2015. In addition, front-end engineering and design (FEED) activities for the second development phase, Stage 2, were completed in September 2015. Drilling of the Stage 2 development wells commenced in fourth quarter 2015 and is planned to continue into 2016. First oil from Stage 2 is expected in 2017, and proved reserves have been recognized for this project. Production from the Jack/St. Malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 94,000 barrels of crude oil and 21 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated remaining production life of 30 years. The development plan for the 60 percent-owned and operated Big Foot Project includes a 15-slot drilling and production platform with water injection facilities and a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Work to install the platform was suspended in second quarter 2015 when nine of 16 mooring tendons lost buoyancy. The remaining tendons were recovered, and the platform was moved to a safe harbor location. As of early 2016, the company is completing reviews of schedule and cost estimate. No production is expected in 2016 or 2017. The field has an estimated production life of 35 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. At the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field, net daily production averaged 31,000 barrels of crude oil, 12 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 2,000 barrels of NGLs. The next development phase, the Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project, entered FEED in mid-2015, and a final investment decision is expected in mid-2016. At the end of 2015, proved reserves had not been recognized for the vertical expansion project. The Tahiti Field has an estimated remaining production life of at least 20 years. The company has a 42.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Tubular Bells Field. In 2015, net daily production averaged 10,000 barrels of crude oil and 20 million cubic feet of natural gas. Development drilling continued during 2015. The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the Mad Dog Field. The first of five planned infill wells commenced production in fourth quarter 2015. The next development phase, the Mad Dog 2 Project, is planned to develop the southern portion of the Mad Dog Field. FEED activities continued during 2015. At the end of 2015, proved reserves had not been recognized for the Mad Dog 2 Project. Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in the Stampede Project, the unitized development of the Knotty Head and Pony discoveries. The planned facilities have a design capacity of 80,000 barrels of crude oil and 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Development drilling commenced in fourth quarter 2015, with first oil expected in 2018. The field has an estimated production life of 30 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. 8 FEED activities progressed in 2015 on a project to jointly develop the 55 percent-owned and operated Buckskin Field and the 87.5 percent-owned and operated Moccasin Field. A decision was made in fourth quarter 2015 not to pursue the development. In January 2016, the company relinquished its interest in Moccasin and transferred the operatorship of Buckskin to another working interest partner. The company plans to transfer its interest in Buckskin to the other working interest owners in 2016. During 2015 and early 2016, the company participated in five appraisal wells and four exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Drilling was completed at the 50 percent-owned and operated Sicily exploration well in second quarter 2015, which resulted in a crude oil discovery. Drilling commenced on an appraisal well at Sicily in December 2015. Appraisal activities, including a sidetrack of the discovery well, at the 55 percent-owned and operated Anchor discovery were completed in fourth quarter 2015 and were successful. Drilling commenced on an additional appraisal well at Anchor in first quarter 2016. Chevron is the operator of an exploration and appraisal program covering 28 jointly held offshore leases in the northwest portion of Keathley Canyon. This area may have the potential to support a multifield hub development of the Guadalupe and Tiber discoveries, with the potential addition of the Gibson prospect. This potential development, named Tigris, is under evaluation as exploration and appraisal work progresses. Drilling of a sidetrack well at the 36 percent-owned and operated Gila discovery was completed in third quarter 2015. The Gila prospect was deemed noncommercial, and two of the leases were relinquished in early 2016. Drilling commenced at a 36 percent-owned and operated Gibson exploration well in fourth quarter 2015 and is planned to be completed in second quarter 2016. Chevron added thirteen leases to its deepwater portfolio as a result of awards from the central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 235, held in first quarter 2015. The company produces crude oil and natural gas in the midcontinent region of the United States, primarily in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. During 2015, net daily production in these areas averaged 116,000 barrels of crude oil, 600 million cubic feet of natural gas and 34,000 barrels of NGLs. The company is pursuing selected opportunities for divestment. In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, development drilling of shale and tight resources in the Midland and Delaware basins focused on horizontal wells with multistage fracture stimulation, where the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,000,000 net acres, respectively. The company drilled 147 wells and participated in 180 nonoperated wells in the Midland and Delaware basins in 2015. The company holds leases in the Marcellus Shale and the Utica Shale, primarily located in southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and the West Virginia panhandle, and in the Antrim Shale and Collingwood/Utica Shale in Michigan. During 2015, net production in these areas averaged 334 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. In 2015, development of the Marcellus Shale progressed at a measured pace and was focused on improving execution capability, well performance and cost effectiveness. Activities in the Utica Shale during 2015 focused on exploration drilling to acquire data necessary for potential future development. Other Americas “Other Americas” includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Greenland, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. Net oil-equivalent production from these countries averaged 224,000 barrels per day during 2015. Canada Upstream activities in Canada are concentrated in Alberta, British Columbia and the offshore Atlantic region. The company also has exploration interests in the Beaufort Sea region of the Northwest Territories. Net oil-equivalent production during 2015 averaged 69,000 barrels per day, composed of 20,000 barrels of crude oil, 14 million cubic feet of natural gas and 47,000 barrels of synthetic oil from oil sands. Chevron holds a 26.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Hibernia Field, which comprises the Hibernia and Ben Nevis Avalon (BNA) reservoirs, and a 23.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Hibernia Southern Extension (HSE) areas offshore Atlantic Canada. Production start-up of HSE was achieved in 2015. The company holds a 29.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the heavy oil Hebron Field, also offshore Atlantic Canada. The development plan includes a platform with a design capacity of 150,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Construction activities progressed in 2015. The project has an expected economic life of 30 years from the time of start-up, and first oil is expected in 2017. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. In the Flemish Pass Basin offshore Newfoundland, Chevron holds a 40 percent nonoperated working interest in two exploration blocks. A 3-D seismic survey was completed on these blocks, and exploratory drilling commenced in the fourth quarter 2015 and is expected to be completed in March 2016. In November 2015, the company was awarded a 35 percent interest and 9 operatorship in another block in the Flemish Pass Basin. The company holds a 20 percent nonoperated working interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) in Alberta. Oil sands are mined from both the Muskeg River and the Jackpine mines, and bitumen is extracted from the oil sands and upgraded into synthetic oil. Construction progressed during 2015 on the Quest Project, and the project was commissioned in the fourth quarter. The Quest Project is designed to capture and store more than one million tons of carbon dioxide produced annually by AOSP bitumen processing. The company holds approximately 228,000 net acres in the Duvernay Shale in Alberta and approximately 200,000 overlying acres in the Montney tight rock formation. Chevron has a 70 percent-owned and operated interest in most of the Duvernay acreage. Production from the initial wells in the Duvernay continued to demonstrate good flow rates and high condensate yields. Drilling continued during 2015 on an expanded 16-well appraisal program. A total of 28 wells had been tied into production facilities by early 2016. Chevron holds a 50 percent-owned and operated interest in the proposed Kitimat LNG and Pacific Trail Pipeline projects and a 50 percent interest in 300,000 net acres in the Horn River and Liard shale gas basins in British Colombia. The Kitimat LNG Project is planned to include a two-train LNG facility and has a 10.0 million-metric-ton-per-year export license. The total production capacity for the project is expected to be 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. Spending is being paced until LNG market conditions and reductions in project costs are sufficient to support the development of this project. The company became operator of the upstream portion of the project in May 2015 and continued with the horizontal appraisal drilling program that began in 2014. At the end of 2015, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. The company holds a 93.8 percent operated interest in the Aitken Creek and a 42.9 percent nonoperated interest in the Alberta Hub natural gas storage facilities, which have an aggregate total capacity of approximately 100 billion cubic feet. These facilities are located adjacent to several shale gas plays. The company is pursuing opportunities for divestment of these interests. Greenland Chevron holds a 29.2 percent-owned and operated interest in Blocks 9 and 14 located in the Kanumas Area, offshore the northeast coast of Greenland. The company acquired 2-D seismic data in 2015 and evaluation of the acreage is ongoing. Argentina In the Vaca Muerta Shale formation, Chevron holds a 50 percent nonoperated interest in two concessions covering 73,000 net acres. Chevron also holds an 85 percent-owned and operated interest in one concession covering 94,000 net acres with both conventional production and Vaca Muerta Shale potential. In addition, the company holds operated interests in three concessions covering 73,000 net acres in the Neuquen Basin, with interests ranging from 18.8 percent to 100 percent. Net oil-equivalent production in 2015 averaged 27,000 barrels per day, composed of 21,000 barrels of crude oil and 36 million cubic feet of natural gas. Development activities continued at the Loma Campana concession in the Vaca Muerta Shale where 156 wells were drilled in 2015, most of which were vertical wells. In 2016, the drilling plan shifts to primarily horizontal wells. During 2015, the company progressed the exploration of shale oil and gas resources in the Narambuena Block in the Chihuido de la Sierra Negra concession, also in the Vaca Muerta Shale. The exploration plan for Narambuena includes nine wells to be drilled in two phases. Brazil Chevron holds interests in the Frade (51.7 percent-owned and operated) and Papa-Terra (37.5 percent-owned and nonoperated) deepwater fields located in the Campos Basin.

Flowline and topsides installations were completed in first quarter 2015 and drilling of the development well commenced in third quarter 2015. First production is expected in second-half 2016. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The Captain Enhanced Oil Recovery Project is the next development phase of the Captain Field and is designed to increase field recovery by injecting polymerized water. FEED activities continued to progress in 2015 and are planned to continue in 2016 as polymer performance is evaluated. At the end of 2015, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. During 2015, fabrication and installation activities continued for the Clair Ridge Project, located west of the Shetland Islands, in which the company has a 19.4 percent nonoperated working interest. The project is the second development phase of the Clair Field. The design capacity of the project is 120,000 barrels of crude oil and 100 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Production is scheduled to begin in 2017. The Clair Field has an estimated production life until 2050. Proved reserves have been recognized for the Clair Ridge Project. At the 40 percent-owned and operated Rosebank Project northwest of the Shetland Islands, the company continued to progress FEED activities for a 17-well subsea development tied back to an FPSO with natural gas exported via pipeline. The design capacity of the project is 100,000 barrels of crude oil and 80 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. At the end of 2015, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. Sales of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) from its producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements. In addition, the company also makes third-party purchases and sales of natural gas and NGLs in connection with its supply and trading activities. During 2015 , U.S. and international sales of natural gas averaged 3.9 billion and 4.3 billion cubic feet per day, respectively, which includes the company’s share of equity affiliates’ sales. Outside the United States, substantially all of the natural gas sales from the company’s producing interests are from operations in Australia, Bangladesh, Europe, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Latin America, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Philippines and Thailand. U.S. and international sales of NGLs averaged 153,000 and 89,000 barrels per day, respectively, in 2015 . Substantially all of the international sales of NGLs from the company's producing interests are from operations in Africa, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and the United Kingdom. Refer to “Selected Operating Data,” on page FS-11 in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information on the company’s sales volumes of natural gas and natural gas liquids. Refer also to “Delivery Commitments” beginning on page 6 for information related to the company’s delivery commitments for the sale of crude oil and natural gas. 17 Downstream Refining Operations At the end of 2015 , the company had a refining network capable of processing over 1.8 million barrels of crude oil per day. Operable capacity at December 31, 2015 , and daily refinery inputs for 2013 through 2015 for the company and affiliate refineries are summarized in the table below. Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2015 was 90 percent, compared with 87 percent in 2014 . At the U.S. refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged 96 percent in 2015 , compared with 91 percent in 2014 . Chevron processes both imported and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about 74 percent and 73 percent of Chevron’s U.S. refinery inputs in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In the United States, the company continued work on projects to improve refinery flexibility, reliability and capability to process lower cost feedstocks. At the Richmond, California refinery, the company received all remaining regulatory approvals in 2015 to resume construction of its modernization project. Engineering is being finalized, and construction activity is expected to restart in 2016. In addition, Chevron is pursuing the possible divestment of the Hawaii Refinery and related assets. Outside the United States, the Singapore Refining Company, Chevron's 50 percent-owned joint venture, progressed construction of a gasoline desulfurization facility and a cogeneration plant. This investment is expected to increase the refinery's capability to produce higher value gasoline and to improve energy efficiency. The company sold its 50 percent interest in Caltex Australia Limited in April 2015. In June 2015, the company sold its interest in a refinery in New Zealand. The company has signed an agreement for the sale of its interest in a refinery in Pakistan, which is pending government approval. The company is also evaluating the sale of its interests in the Cape Town Refinery in South Africa. Petroleum Refineries: Locations, Capacities and Inputs 18 Marketing Operations The company markets petroleum products under the principal brands of “Chevron,” “Texaco” and “Caltex” throughout many parts of the world. The following table identifies the company’s and affiliates’ refined products sales volumes, excluding intercompany sales, for the three years ended December 31, 2015 . Refined Products Sales Volumes In the United States, the company markets under the Chevron and Texaco brands. At year-end 2015 , the company supplied directly or through retailers and marketers approximately 7,860 Chevron- and Texaco-branded motor vehicle service stations, primarily in the southern and western states. Approximately 370 of these outlets are company-owned or -leased stations. Outside the United States, Chevron supplied directly or through retailers and marketers approximately 6,090 branded service stations, including affiliates. In British Columbia, Canada, the company markets under the Chevron brand. The company markets in Latin America using the Texaco brand. In the Asia-Pacific region, southern Africa and the Middle East, the company uses the Caltex brand. The company also operates through affiliates under various brand names. In South Korea, the company operates through its 50 percent-owned affiliate, GS Caltex. Divestments of fuels marketing operations in 2015 include those owned by Caltex Australia Limited, as well as company-owned operations in Pakistan. The company expects to complete the sale of its New Zealand marketing operations in second quarter 2016, pending government approval. The company is also pursuing the sale of its marketing and lubricants businesses in southern Africa. Chevron markets commercial aviation fuel at approximately 100 airports worldwide. The company also markets an extensive line of lubricant and coolant products under the product names Havoline, Delo, Ursa, Meropa, Rando, Clarity and Taro in the United States and worldwide under the three brands: Chevron, Texaco and Caltex. Chemicals Operations Chevron owns a 50 percent interest in its Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) affiliate. CPChem produces olefins, polyolefins and alpha olefins and is a supplier of aromatics and polyethylene pipe, in addition to participating in the specialty chemical and specialty plastics markets. At the end of 2015 , CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 34 manufacturing facilities and two research and development centers around the world. In second quarter 2015, CPChem completed construction and started commercial operations of a 100,000 metric-ton-per-year expansion of normal alpha olefins production capacity at its Cedar Bayou Plant in Baytown, Texas. In 2015, construction advanced on the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, which is expected to capitalize on advantaged feedstock sourced from shale gas development in North America. The project includes an ethane cracker with an annual design capacity of 1.5 million metric tons of ethylene to be located at the Cedar Bayou facility and two polyethylene units to be located in Old Ocean, Texas, with a combined annual design capacity of one million metric tons. Start-up is expected in 2017. Chevron Oronite Company develops, manufactures and markets performance additives for lubricating oils and fuels and conducts research and development for additive component and blended packages. At the end of 2015, the company manufactured, blended or conducted research at 10 locations around the world. In 2015, the company progressed construction on a carboxylate plant in Singapore with expected start-up in 2017. In addition, an investment agreement was signed to build an additive manufacturing plant in Ningbo, China. The plant design is under development, with a final investment decision expected by 2018. 19 Chevron also maintains a role in the petrochemical business through the operations of GS Caltex, a 50 percent-owned affiliate. GS Caltex manufactures aromatics, including benzene, toluene and xylene. These base chemicals are used to produce a range of products, including adhesives, plastics and textile fibers. GS Caltex also produces polypropylene, which is used to make food packaging, laboratory equipment and textiles. Transportation Pipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquid, refined product and chemical pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and indirect interests in other U.S. and international pipelines. Refer to pages 12 and 13 in the Upstream section for information on the West African Gas Pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, the Western Route Export Pipeline and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Shipping The company's marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign-flagged vessels. The U.S.-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting refined products, primarily in the coastal waters of the United States. The foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Black Sea, South America, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia, as well as refined products and feedstocks to and from various locations worldwide. In 2015, the company took delivery of two additional LNG carriers in support of its developing LNG portfolio. Together with 2014 deliveries, four of six new LNG vessels have been delivered to the fleet. Other Businesses Research and Technology Chevron's energy technology organization supports upstream and downstream businesses. The company conducts research, develops and qualifies technology, and provides technical services and competency development. The disciplines cover earth sciences, reservoir and production engineering, drilling and completions, facilities engineering, manufacturing, process technology, catalysis, technical computing and health, environment and safety. Chevron's information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, cybersecurity and network technology to provide a digital infrastructure to enable Chevron’s global operations and business processes. Chevron's technology ventures company supports Chevron's upstream and downstream businesses by bridging the gap between business unit needs and emerging technology solutions developed externally in areas of emerging materials, water management, information technology, power systems and production enhancement. Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Refer to Note 27 beginning on page FS-59 for a summary of the company's research and development expenses. Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to  minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. To complement the company’s capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP). SWRP’s objective is to further develop the industry’s capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page FS-16 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2015 environmental expenditures. Refer to page FS-16 and Note 24 on page FS-57 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 21 through 23 for a discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change. 20 Item 1A. Risk Factors Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the company's control and could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company’s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends. The scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions involve uncertainty analysis, which incorporates potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. The company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic 21 materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to Ecuador matters, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-42. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevron’s business The company’s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. In addition, changes in national or state environmental regulations, including those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability. Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase Chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron’s  hydrocarbon and other products Continued attention to issues concerning GHG emissions and climate change and potential mitigation through legislation and regulation could have a material impact on the company’s operations and financial results. International agreements (e.g., the Paris Accord and the Kyoto Protocol) and national (e.g., carbon tax, cap-and-trade or efficiency standards), regional and state legislation (e.g., California's AB32 or other low carbon fuel standards) and regulatory measures (e.g., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's methane performance standards) to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation and it is difficult to predict with certainty their timing and outcome. These and other GHG emissions-related laws and regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbon-based products, make the company’s products more expensive, and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes, revenues and margins. GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, that could be regulated include, among others, those arising from the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products. Some of these activities, such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products, as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the company’s control. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential GHG emissions laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the company’s activities in it and market conditions. 22 The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions on the company’s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the company’s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products. Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the company’s periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company’s business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

Legal Proceedings Governmental Proceedings As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed on February 21, 2014, on August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron U.S.A. Inc. refinery in Richmond, California. Various federal, state, and local agencies initiated investigations as a result of the incident. Based on its civil investigation, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Finding of Violations (FOV) to Chevron on December 17, 2013, which includes 62 findings of alleged noncompliance at the refinery. The majority of these findings relate to the August 2012 fire and alleged violations of chemical-accident-prevention laws, but the FOV also addresses a number of release-reporting issues, some of which are unrelated to the fire. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As initially disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed on February 21, 2014, in July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties in conjunction with commitments Chevron undertook to install and operate certain air emission control equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to a Clean Air Act settlement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the DOH. The company reached a settlement agreement with the EPA and the DOH and paid civil penalties totaling $230,958 to resolve the alleged violations. As initially disclosed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015, filed on November 6, 2015, on July 29, 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notified Chevron that certain Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits it had submitted for compliance with the federal Renewable Fuel Standard for 2011 were invalid because they were fraudulently generated by a third party that sold the credits to Chevron.  On September 30, 2015, Chevron received a civil penalty demand of $175,923 from the EPA for the submission of the invalid RINs.  The company paid $175,923 in civil penalties to resolve the demand.

Business Environment and Outlook Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil. The price of crude oil has fallen significantly since mid-year 2014, reflecting persistently high global crude oil inventories and production. The downturn in the price of crude oil has impacted, and, depending upon its duration, will continue to significantly impact the company's results of operations, cash flows, leverage, capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook. The company is responding with reductions in operating expenses, including employee reductions, reductions in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2016 and future periods, and increased asset sales. The company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future, as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance; however, the timing of any such increase is unknown. In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Refer to the "Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information" on page 2 and to "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 21 through 23 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition. The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and growth. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page FS-6 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2015 . Asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses. The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning. FS- -2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows: Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations. The company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. However, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. In recent years, Chevron and the oil and gas industry generally experienced an increase in certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. As a result of the decline in prices of crude oil and other commodities since mid-2014, these cost pressures have softened. Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors. The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $52 per barrel for the full-year 2015 , compared to $99 in 2014 . As of mid-February 2016 , the Brent price was $31 per barrel. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. Prices firmed in the first half of 2015, but declined in the remainder of the year amid persistently high global crude oil inventories and production. The WTI price averaged $49 per barrel for the full-year 2015 , compared to $93 in 2014 . As of mid-February 2016 , the WTI price was $29 per barrel. WTI traded at a discount to Brent throughout 2015 due to high inventories and excess crude supply in the U.S. market. With the lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban in December 2015, the spread between WTI and Brent narrowed substantially and WTI traded around parity into February 2016. A differential in crude oil prices exists between high-quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). The amount of the differential in any period is associated with the relative supply/demand balances for each crude type, which are functions of the capacity of refineries that are able to process each as feedstock into high-value light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). In second-half 2015, the differential expanded in North America as Canadian heavy crude production recovered from earlier planned and unplanned outages, while light sweet crude prices in the U.S. were supported by reductions in the rig count and slowing domestic production growth. Outside of North FS- -3 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations America, high refinery runs in Europe and Asia supported pricing for light sweet crude from the Atlantic Basin, while increased output from Iraq and other Middle East producers pressured values of heavier, more sour crudes. Chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in Angola, China and the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. (See page FS-11 for the company’s average U.S. and international crude oil realizations.) In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. Fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the United States are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in North America. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $2.62 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2015 , compared with $4.28 during 2014 . As of mid-February 2016 , the Henry Hub spot price was $1.92 per MCF. Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. Chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most locations. In some locations, Chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. The company's long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Approximately 85 percent of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is targeted to be sold into binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the Asian spot LNG market.  The Asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for LNG in the Pacific Basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices. International natural gas realizations averaged $4.53 per MCF during 2015 , compared with $5.78 per MCF during 2014 . (See page FS-11 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.) The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2015 averaged 2.622 million barrels per day. About one-fifth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2015 occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria, Venezuela and the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. OPEC quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production in 2015 or 2014 . At their December 2015 meeting, members of OPEC did not agree on a target production level, and in January 2016 western sanctions on Iran were lifted. As such, OPEC output is now considered likely to increase from recent levels of approximately 31.5 million barrels per day as Iranian production and exports recover. The company estimates that net oil-equivalent production in 2016 will be flat to 4 percent growth compared to 2015. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including the duration of the low price environment that began in second-half  2014; quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; or other disruptions FS- -4 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. A significant majority of Chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the United States. In the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in May 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits. Net oil-equivalent production in the Partitioned Zone in 2014 was 81,000 barrels per day. During 2015, net oil-equivalent production averaged 28,000 barrels per day. As of early 2016, production remains shut-in and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The financial effects from the loss of production in 2015 were not significant and are not expected to be significant in 2016. Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.2 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end 2015 , an increase of 1 percent from year-end 2014 . The reserve replacement ratio in 2015 was 107 percent. Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-65 for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2013 and each year-end from 2013 through 2015 , and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2015 . Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages FS-6 through FS-8 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business. Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events. Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets. The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Asia and southern Africa. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages FS-6 through FS-8 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations. All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies. Operating Developments Key operating developments and other events during 2015 and early 2016 included the following: Upstream Angola-Republic of Congo Joint Development Area Achieved first production from the Lianzi Project. Australia Progressed LNG Train 1 commissioning and start-up activities for the Gorgon Project, with first cargo lifting expected in March 2016. All Train 2 modules are installed, and all remaining Train 3 modules were delivered as of January 2016. Progressed construction of the Wheatstone Project. Major milestones reached include the installation of the offshore platform and topsides, and all of the subsea pipelines and structures, along with the delivery of all LNG Train 1 and common modules.

Downstream Australia Completed the sale of the company’s 50 percent interest in Caltex Australia Limited. New Zealand Completed the sale of the company’s interest in The New Zealand Refining Company Limited and reached agreement to sell the company’s marketing operations. Other Common Stock Dividends The 2015 annual dividend was $4.28 per share, making 2015 the 28th consecutive year that the company increased its annual dividend payout. Results of Operations The following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company’s business segments – Upstream and Downstream – as well as for “All Other.” Earnings are also presented for the U.S. and international geographic areas of the Upstream and Downstream business segments. Refer to Note 14, beginning on page FS-37, for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments.” This section should also be read in conjunction with the discussion in “Business Environment and Outlook” on pages FS-2 through FS-5. U.S. Upstream U.S. upstream operations incurred a loss of $4.06 billion in 2015 compared to earnings of $3.33 billion from 2014 . The decrease was primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas realizations of $4.86 billion and $570 million, respectively, higher depreciation expenses of $2.19 billion and higher exploration expenses of $650 million. The increase in depreciation and exploration expenses was primarily due to impairments and project cancellations. Lower gains on asset sales also contributed to the decrease with current year gains of $110 million compared with $700 million in 2014.  Partially offsetting these effects were higher crude oil production of $900 million and lower operating expenses of $450 million. U.S. upstream earnings of $3.33 billion in 2014 decreased $717 million from 2013 , primarily due to lower crude oil prices of $950 million. Higher depreciation expenses of $440 million and higher operating expenses of $210 million also contributed to the decline. Partially offsetting the decrease were gains on asset sales of $700 million in 2014 compared with $60 million in 2013, higher natural gas realizations of $150 million and higher crude oil production of $100 million. FS- -6 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2015 was $42.70 per barrel, compared with $84.13 in 2014 and $93.46 in 2013 . The average natural gas realization was $1.92 per thousand cubic feet in 2015 , compared with $3.90 in 2014 and $3.37 in 2013 . Net oil-equivalent production in 2015 averaged 720,000 barrels per day, up 8 percent from 2014 and 10 percent from 2013 . Between 2015 and 2014 , production increases due to project ramp-ups in the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico were partially offset by the effect of asset sales and normal field declines. Between 2014 and 2013 , production increases in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania were partially offset by normal field declines. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2015 averaged 501,000 barrels per day, up 10 percent from 2014 and 12 percent from 2013 . Net natural gas production averaged about 1.3 billion cubic feet per day in 2015 , up 5 percent from 2014 and 2013 . Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table on page FS-11 for a three-year comparison of production volumes in the United States. International Upstream International upstream earnings were $2.09 billion in 2015 compared with $13.57 billion in 2014 . The decrease between periods was primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas realizations of $10.57 billion and $880 million, respectively, and higher depreciation expenses of $1.11 billion, primarily reflecting impairments. Lower gains on asset sales also contributed to the decrease with current year gains of $370 million compared with $1.10 billion in 2014. Partially offsetting the decrease were higher crude oil sales volumes of $590 million and lower operating expenses of $510 million. Foreign currency effects increased earnings by $725 million in 2015 , compared with an increase of $597 million a year earlier. International upstream earnings were $13.57 billion in 2014 compared with $16.77 billion in 2013 . The decrease between periods was primarily due to lower crude oil prices and sales volumes of $1.97 billion and $400 million, respectively. Also contributing to the decrease were higher depreciation expenses of $1.02 billion, mainly related to impairments and other asset write-offs, and higher operating and tax expenses of $340 million and $310 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these items were gains on asset sales of  $1.10 billion in 2014, compared with $140 million in 2013. Foreign currency effects increased earnings by $597 million in 2014 , compared with a decrease of $559 million a year earlier. The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2015 was $46.52 per barrel, compared with $90.42 in 2014 and $100.26 in 2013 . The average natural gas realization was $4.53 per thousand cubic feet in 2015 , compared with $5.78 and $5.91 in 2014 and 2013 , respectively. International net oil-equivalent production was 1.90 million barrels per day in 2015 , essentially unchanged from 2014 and down 2 percent from 2013 . Between 2015 and 2014, production increases from entitlement effects in several locations and project ramp-ups in Bangladesh and other areas were offset by the Partitioned Zone shut-in, normal field declines and the effect of asset sales. Between 2014 and 2013, production increases due to project ramp-ups in Nigeria, Argentina and Brazil were more than offset by normal field declines, production entitlement effects in several locations and the effect of asset sales. The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 1.24 million barrels per day in 2015 , a decrease of approximately 1 percent from 2014 and a decrease of approximately 3 percent from 2013 . International net natural gas production of 4.0 billion cubic feet per day in 2015 was up 1 percent from 2014 and unchanged from 2013 . Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table, on page FS-11, for a three-year comparison of international production volumes. FS- -7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations U.S. Downstream U.S. downstream operations earned $3.18 billion in 2015 , compared with $2.64 billion in 2014 . The increase was due to higher margins on refined product sales of $1.51 billion, partially offset by the absence of 2014 asset sale gains of $960 million. U.S. downstream operations earned $2.64 billion in 2014 , compared with $787 million in 2013 . The increase in earnings was mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales of $830 million. Gains from asset sales were $960 million in 2014, compared with $250 million in 2013. Higher earnings from 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LLC (CPChem) of $160 million and lower operating expenses of $80 million also contributed to the earnings increase. Refined product sales of 1.23 million barrels per day in 2015 increased 1 percent, mainly reflecting higher sales of jet fuel. Sales volumes of refined products were 1.21 million barrels per day in 2014 , an increase of 2 percent from 2013 , mainly reflecting higher gas oil sales. U.S. branded gasoline sales of 522,000 barrels per day in 2015 increased 1 percent from 2014 and 2013 . Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table on page FS-11 for a three-year comparison of sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes. International Downstream International downstream earned $4.42 billion in 2015 , compared with $1.70 billion in 2014 . The increase was primarily due to a $1.6 billion gain from the sale of the company’s interest in Caltex Australia Limited in second quarter 2015 and higher margins on refined product sales of $690 million. Foreign currency effects increased earnings by $47 million in 2015 , compared to a decrease of $112 million a year earlier. International downstream earned $1.70 billion in 2014 , compared with $1.45 billion in 2013 . The increase was mainly due to a favorable change in the effects on derivative instruments of $640 million. The increase was partially offset by the economic buyout of a legacy pension obligation of $160 million in the 2014 period, lower margins on refined product sales of $130 million and higher tax expenses of $110 million. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $112 million in 2014 , compared with a decrease of $76 million a year earlier. Total refined product sales of 1.51 million barrels per day in 2015 were essentially unchanged from 2014. Excluding the effects of the Caltex Australia Limited divestment, refined product sales were up 107,000 barrels per day, primarily reflecting higher sales of jet fuel, gasoline and gas oil. Sales of 1.50 million barrels per day in 2014 declined 2 percent from 2013, mainly reflecting lower gas oil sales. Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table, on page FS-11, for a three-year comparison of sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes. All Other All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies. Net charges in 2015 decreased $935 million from 2014 , mainly due to lower corporate tax items and the absence of 2014 charges related to mining assets, partially offset by higher charges related to reductions in corporate staffs. Net charges in 2014 increased $365 million from 2013 , mainly due to higher environmental reserve additions, asset impairments and additional asset retirement obligations for mining assets, as well as higher corporate tax items. These increases were partially offset by the absence of 2013 impairments of power-related affiliates and lower other corporate charges. FS- -8 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Statement of Income Comparative amounts for certain income statement categories are shown below: Sales and other operating revenues decreased in 2015 primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil prices, partially offset by an increase in refined product and crude oil volumes. The decrease between 2014 and 2013 was mainly due to lower crude oil volumes, and lower refined product and crude oil prices. Income from equity affiliates decreased in 2015 from 2014 mainly due to lower earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan, CPChem, Angola LNG and the effect of the sale of Caltex Australia Limited in second quarter 2015. Partially offsetting these effects were higher earnings from GS Caltex in South Korea and Petropiar in Venezuela. Income from equity affiliates decreased in 2014 from 2013 mainly due to lower upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan, Petropiar and Petroboscan in Venezuela, and Angola LNG. Partially offsetting these effects were higher downstream-related earnings from GS Caltex in South Korea, higher earnings from CPChem and the absence of 2013 impairments of power-related affiliates. Refer to Note 15, beginning on page FS-40, for a discussion of Chevron’s investments in affiliated companies. Other income of $3.9 billion in 2015 included net gains from asset sales of $3.2 billion before-tax. Other income in 2014 and 2013 included net gains from asset sales of $3.6 billion and $710 million before-tax, respectively. Interest income was approximately $119 million in 2015 , $145 million in 2014 and $136 million in 2013 . Foreign currency effects increased other income by $82 million in 2015 , $277 million in 2014 and $103 million in 2013 . Crude oil and product purchases of $69.8 billion were down in 2015 mainly due to lower crude oil and refined product prices, partially offset by an increase in crude oil volumes. Crude oil and product purchases in 2014 decreased by $15.0 billion from the prior year, mainly due to lower crude oil and refined product prices, along with lower crude oil volumes. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.3 billion between 2015 and 2014 . The decrease included  lower fuel costs of $920 million. Also contributing to the decrease were lower expenses for construction, repair and maintenance of $300 million, contract labor of $270 million, and research, technical and professional services of $200 million. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $642 million between 2014 and 2013 . The increase included higher employee compensation and benefit costs of $360 million, primarily related to a buyout of a legacy pension obligation. Also contributing to the increase was higher transportation costs of $350 million, primarily reflecting the economic buyout of a long-term contractual obligation, and higher environmental expenses related to a mining asset of $300 million. Partially offsetting the increase were lower fuel expenses of $360 million. Exploration expenses in 2015 increased from 2014 mainly due to higher charges for well write-offs largely related to project cancellations. Exploration expenses in 2014 increased from 2013 mainly due to higher charges for well write-offs, partially offset by lower geological and geophysical expenses. FS- -9 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses increased in 2015 from 2014 mainly due to impairments of oil and gas producing fields of about $3.5 billion in 2015 compared with $900 million in 2014. Also contributing to the increase were higher depreciation rates and higher production levels for certain oil and gas producing fields. The increase in 2014 from 2013 was mainly due to higher depreciation rates and impairments for certain oil and gas producing fields, and the impairment of a mining asset. Taxes other than on income decreased in 2015 from 2014 mainly due to lower crude oil and refined product prices. Taxes other than on income decreased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to a decrease in duty expense in South Africa along with lower consumer excise taxes in Thailand, reflecting lower sales volumes at both locations. Effective income tax rates were 3 percent in 2015 , 38 percent in 2014 and 40 percent in 2013 . The decrease in the effective tax rate between 2015 and 2014 primarily resulted from the impacts of jurisdictional mix, one-time tax benefits, foreign currency remeasurement, equity earnings and a reduction in statutory tax rates in the United Kingdom, partially offset by the effects of valuation allowances recognized on deferred tax assets and the sale of the company's interest in Caltex Australia Limited. The rate decreased between 2014 and 2013 primarily due to the impact of changes in jurisdictional mix and equity earnings, and the tax effects related to the 2014 sale of interests in Chad and Cameroon, partially offset by other one-time and ongoing tax charges. FS- -10 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Selected Operating Data 1,2 FS- -11 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, Cash Equivalents, Time Deposits and Marketable Securities Total balances were $11.3 billion and $13.2 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was $19.5 billion , compared with $31.5 billion in 2014 and $35.0 billion in 2013 . Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $0.9 billion , $0.4 billion and $1.2 billion in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $5.7 billion in 2015 , $5.7 billion in 2014 , and $1.1 billion in 2013 . Restricted cash of $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream abandonment activities, tax payments, and funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and asset acquisitions and divestitures. Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $8.0 billion in 2015 , $7.9 billion in 2014 and $7.5 billion in 2013 . Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Total debt and capital lease obligations were $38.6 billion at December 31, 2015 , up from $27.8 billion at year-end 2014 . The $10.8 billion increase in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2015 was primarily due to funding the company’s capital investment program, which included several large projects in the construction phase. The company completed bond issuances of $6 billion and $5 billion in March and November 2015, respectively. The company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $12.9 billion at December 31, 2015 , compared with $11.8 billion at year-end 2014 . Of these amounts, $8.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at the end of both periods. At year-end 2015 , settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2016 , as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2018 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company. The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation and Texaco Capital Inc. All of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation. In February 2016, Standard & Poor's Corporation changed its rating for these securities from AA to AA-. These securities are rated Aa1 by Moody’s Investors FS- -12 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and P-l by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending plans to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings. Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Short-Term Debt, on page FS-48. Common Stock Repurchase Program In July 2010, the Board of Directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. The company did not acquire any shares under the program in 2015 . From the inception of the program through 2014, the company had purchased 180.9 million shares for $20.0 billion. Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: Total expenditures for 2015 were $34.0 billion , including $3.4 billion for the company’s share of equity-affiliate expenditures, which did not require cash outlays by the company. In 2014 and 2013 , expenditures were $ 40.3 billion and $ 41.9 billion, respectively, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $ 3.5 billion and $ 2.7 billion, respectively. Of the $34.0 billion of expenditures in 2015 , 92 percent , or $31.1 billion , was related to upstream activities. Approximately 92 percent and 90 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2014 and 2013 , respectively. International upstream accounted for 76 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2015 , 76 percent in 2014 and 78 percent in 2013 . The company estimates that 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $26.6 billion, including $4.5 billion of spending by affiliates. This planned reduction, compared to 2015 expenditures, is in response to current crude oil market conditions.  Approximately 90 percent of the total, or $24.0 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities. Approximately $9 billion of planned upstream capital spending is for existing base producing assets, which include shale and tight resource investments. Approximately $11 billion is related to major capital projects currently underway, and approximately $3 billion relates to projects yet to be sanctioned. Global exploration funding accounts for approximately $1 billion. The company will continue to monitor crude oil market conditions, and will further restrict capital outlays should current oil price conditions persist. Worldwide downstream spending in 2016 is estimated at $2.2 billion, with $1.6 billion for projects in the United States. Investments in technology companies and other corporate businesses in 2016 are budgeted at $0.4 billion. Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $1.2 billion at both December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 . Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $128 million and $47 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Pension Obligations Information related to pension plan contributions is included on page FS-56 in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.” FS- -13 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Ratios Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2015 , the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $3.7 billion . Interest Coverage Ratio Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2015 was lower than 2014 and 2013 due to lower income. Debt Ratio Total debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders' Equity, which indicates the company’s leverage. The company's debt ratio in 2015 was higher than 2014 and 2013 as the company took on more debt to finance its ongoing investment program. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Guarantees and Other Contingencies Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2016 – $2.1 billion ; 2017 – $1.9 billion ; 2018 – $1.7 billion ; 2019 – $1.5 billion ; 2020 – $1.1 billion ; 2020 and after – $3.1 billion . A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $1.9 billion in 2015 , $3.7 billion in 2014 and $3.6 billion in 2013 . The following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations: FS- -14 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Direct Guarantees The company’s guarantee of $447 million is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 12 -year remaining term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee. Indemnifications Information related to indemnifications is included on page FS-57 in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Indemnifications.” Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the company’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2015 . The company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies, which are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors. Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2015 was not material to the company's results of operations. The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method with a 95 percent confidence level as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. A one-day holding period is used on the assumption that market-risk positions can be liquidated or hedged within one day. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company's primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was not material to the company's cash flows or results of operations. Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2015 . Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2015 , the company had no interest rate swaps. Transactions With Related Parties Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” in Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, page FS-41, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party. FS- -15 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Litigation and Other Contingencies MTBE Information related to methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) matters is included on page FS-42 in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “MTBE.” Ecuador Information related to Ecuador matters is included in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Ecuador,” beginning on page FS-42. Environmental The following table displays the annual changes to the company’s before-tax environmental remediation reserves, including those for federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws. The company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately $15.6 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2015 related primarily to upstream properties. For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2015 environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 24 on page FS-58 for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Note 25 on page FS-59 for additional discussion of the company's asset retirement obligations. Suspended Wells Information related to suspended wells is included in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells, beginning on page FS-49. Income Taxes Information related to income tax contingencies is included on pages FS-45 through FS-48 in Note 18 and page FS-57 in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Income Taxes.” Other Contingencies Information related to other contingencies is included on page FS-58 in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Other Contingencies.” Environmental Matters The company is subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. For example, international agreements (e.g., the Paris Accord and the Kyoto Protocol) and national (e.g., carbon tax, cap-and-trade, or efficiency standards), regional, and state legislation (e.g., California's AB32 or other low carbon fuel standards)  and regulatory measures (e.g., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's methane performance standards)  to limit or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulation are integrated into the company’s strategy, planning and capital investment reviews, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the international, national and state levels. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 21 through 23 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. FS- -16 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, or other hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company's liquidity or financial position. Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2015 at approximately $2.7 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $0.9 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.8 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites. For 2016 , total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.6 billion . These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein: The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs. The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron's Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following: FS- -17 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations oil and gas properties was $13.9 billion , and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2015 were 4.7 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A in 2015 would have increased by approximately $730 million . Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,” beginning on page FS-65, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ending December 31, 2015 , and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” on page FS-71 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2015 . This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-28, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 16 beginning on page FS-41 and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," beginning on page FS-28. The company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets’ associated carrying values. Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable. The company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties during 2015 primarily as a result of downward revisions in the company's longer-term crude oil price outlook. The impairments were primarily in Brazil and the United States. No material individual impairments of PP&E or Investments were recorded for the years 2014 and 2013. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets. FS- -18 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2015 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 on page FS-59 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 23, beginning on page FS-51, includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions. The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the Company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page FS-54 in Note 23 under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the world's financial markets. For 2015 , the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.5 percent and a discount rate of 3.7 percent for U.S. pension plans. The actual return for 2015 was slightly negative due to a broad decline in financial markets in the second half of the year. For the 10 years ending December 31, 2015 , actual asset returns averaged 5.0 percent for the plan. Additionally, with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 7.5 percent during each year. Total pension expense for 2015 was $1.2 billion . An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 61 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2015 by approximately $95 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2015 by approximately $221 million. The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2015 , was a net liability of approximately $4.5 billion . An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2015 , the company used a discount rate of 4.0 percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 63 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $384 million, which would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately $1.7 billion to $1.3 billion. For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2015 was $271 million , and the total liability, which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2015 , was $3.3 billion . For the main U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a 4.1 percent discount rate to measure expense in 2015 , and a 4.5 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2015 . Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2015 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2015 . For information on the sensitivity of the health care cost-trend rate, refer to page FS-54 in Note 23 under the heading “Other Benefit Assumptions.” Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page FS-53 in Note 23 for a description of the method used to amortize the $6.3 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2015 , and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2016 . In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page FS-56 in Note 23 under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.” Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability FS- -19 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because  of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 24 beginning on page FS-57. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2015 . An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur. Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. As part of that accounting, the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the company’s proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliate’s equity currently in income. Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values. Fair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market. Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet. Short-Term Investments All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the company’s cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as “Cash equivalents.” Bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days are reported as “Time deposits.” The balance of short-term investments is reported as “Marketable securities” and is marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in “Other comprehensive income.” Inventories Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories generally are stated at average cost. Properties, Plant and Equipment The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending FS- -28 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 21, beginning on page FS-49, for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs. Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net before-tax cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net before-tax cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense. Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 9, beginning on page FS-34, relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 25, on page FS-59, relating to AROs. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed. The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets. Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other income.” Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized. Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized. Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 25, on page FS-59, for a discussion of the company’s AROs. For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured. FS- -29 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the Consolidated Statement of Equity. Revenue Recognition Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from properties in which Chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized using the entitlement method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. The associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the Consolidated Statement of Income, on page FS-23. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The company amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis. Note 2 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses The change in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses (AOCL) presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the impact of significant amounts reclassified from AOCL on information presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ending December 31, 2015 , are reflected in the table below. Note 3 Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income. The term “earnings” is defined as “Net Income Attributable to Chevron Corporation.” FS- -30 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Activity for the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is as follows: Note 4 Information Relating to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The “ Net increase in operating working capital ” includes reductions of $17 , $58 and $79 for excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. These amounts are offset by an equal amount in “ Net sales (purchases) of treasury shares .” "Other" includes changes in postretirement benefits obligations and other long-term liabilities. The “ Net sales (purchases) of treasury shares ” represents the cost of common shares acquired less the cost of shares issued for share-based compensation plans. Purchases totaled $2 , $5,006 and $5,004 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. No purchases were made under the company's share repurchase program in 2015 . In 2014 and 2013 , the company purchased 41.5 million and 41.6 million common shares for $5,000 and $5,000 under its share repurchase program, respectively. In 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , “ Net sales (purchases) of other short-term investments ” generally consisted of restricted cash associated with upstream abandonment activities, tax payments, and funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and asset acquisitions and divestitures that was invested in cash and short-term securities and reclassified from “Cash and cash equivalents” to “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet that did not affect cash. "Depreciation, depletion and amortization," "Dry hole expense" and "Deferred income tax provision" collectively include approximately $3,700 in non-cash reductions to properties, plant and equipment recorded in 2015 relating to impairments and project suspensions and associated adverse tax effects, primarily as a result of downward revisions in the company's longer-term crude oil price outlook. FS- -31 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Refer also to Note 25, on page FS-59, for a discussion of revisions to the company’s AROs that also did not involve cash receipts or payments for the three years ending December 31, 2015 . The major components of “Capital expenditures” and the reconciliation of this amount to the reported capital and exploratory expenditures, including equity affiliates, are presented in the following table: Note 5 New Accounting Standards Revenue Recognition (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09) In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09, which becomes effective for the company January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted at the original effective date of January 1, 2017. The standard provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for contracts with customers, eliminates most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance, and expands disclosure requirements. The company is evaluating the effect of the standard on its consolidated financial statements. The company does not intend to proceed with early adoption. Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17) In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which becomes effective for the company January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The standard provides that all deferred income taxes be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The current requirement is to classify most deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the classification of the underlying asset or liability. Adoption of the standard will  not have an impact on the company's results of operations or liquidity. Note 6 Lease Commitments Certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased assets are included as part of “Properties, plant and equipment, at cost” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such leasing arrangements involve crude oil production and processing equipment, service stations, bareboat charters, office buildings, and other facilities. Other leases are classified as operating leases and are not capitalized. The payments on operating leases are recorded as expense. Details of the capitalized leased assets are as follows: FS- -32 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Rental expenses incurred for operating leases during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Contingent rentals are based on factors other than the passage of time, principally sales volumes at leased service stations. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rentals to reflect changes in price indices, renewal options ranging up to 25 years, and options to purchase the leased property during or at the end of the initial or renewal lease period for the fair market value or other specified amount at that time. At December 31, 2015 , the estimated future minimum lease payments (net of noncancelable sublease rentals) under operating and capital leases, which at inception had a noncancelable term of more than one year, were as follows: Note 7 Summarized Financial Data – Chevron U.S.A. Inc. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA) is a major subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. CUSA and its subsidiaries manage and operate most of Chevron’s U.S. businesses. Assets include those related to the exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and those associated with the refining, marketing, supply and distribution of products derived from petroleum, excluding most of the regulated pipeline operations of Chevron. CUSA also holds the company’s investment in the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC joint venture, which is accounted for using the equity method. The summarized financial information for CUSA and its consolidated subsidiaries is as follows: FS- -33 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 8 Summarized Financial Data – Tengizchevroil LLP Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO). Refer to Note 15, beginning on page FS-40, for a discussion of TCO operations. Summarized financial information for 100 percent of TCO is presented in the table below: Note 9 Fair Value Measurements The tables below and on the next page show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 . Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2015 . Derivatives The company records its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information. Properties, Plant and Equipment The company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties during 2015 primarily as a result of downward revisions in the company's longer-term crude oil price outlook. The impairments were primarily in Brazil and the United States. The company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties and a mining asset in 2014 . Investments and Advances The company did not have any material investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2015 or 2014 . Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis FS- -34 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value The company holds cash equivalents and time deposits in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $11,022 and $12,785 at December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 , respectively. The instruments held in “Time deposits” are bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days, and had carrying/fair values of zero and $8 at December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 , respectively. The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31, 2015 . "Cash and cash equivalents” do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,100 and $1,474 at December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 , respectively. At December 31, 2015 , these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds related to upstream abandonment activities, tax payments, and funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and asset acquisitions and divestitures, which are reported in “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt of $25,584 and $15,960 at December 31, 2015 , and December 31, 2014 , had estimated fair values of $25,884 and $16,450 , respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is $25,117 and classified as Level 1. The fair value of the other bonds is $767 and classified as Level 2. The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , were not material. Note 10 Financial and Derivative Instruments Derivative Commodity Instruments The company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the company’s derivative instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the company’s affiliates make such designation. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities. The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2015 , December 31, 2014 , and December 31, 2013 , and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are on the next page: FS- -35 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Consolidated Balance Sheet: Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Consolidated Statement of Income: The Effect of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments The table below represents gross and net derivative assets and liabilities subject to netting agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 . Consolidated Balance Sheet: The Effect of Netting Derivative Assets and Liabilities Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for "a right of offset." Concentrations of Credit Risk The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments. The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company’s diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the company’s broad customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers. Note 11 Assets Held for Sale At December 31, 2015 , the company classified $1,449 of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream and downstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2015 were not material. FS- -36 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 12 Equity Retained earnings at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , included approximately $15,010 and $14,512 , respectively, for the company’s share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates. At December 31, 2015 , about 114 million shares of Chevron’s common stock remained available for issuance from the 260 million shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition, approximately 120,753 shares remain available for issuance from the 800,000 shares of the company’s common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron Corporation Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan. Note 13 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon “Net Income Attributable to Chevron Corporation” (“earnings”) and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company. Diluted EPS includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the company’s stock option programs (refer to Note 22, “Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation,” beginning on page FS-50). The table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS: * There was no effect of dividend equivalents paid on stock units or dilutive impact of employee stock-based awards on earnings. Note 14 Operating Segments and Geographic Data Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies. The company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the company’s operations are reported as "International” (outside the United States). FS- -37 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.” Earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table: Segment Assets Segment assets do not include intercompany investments or receivables. Assets at year-end 2015 and 2014 are as follows: 1 2014 conformed to 2015 presentation. Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Operating segment sales and other operating revenues, including internal transfers, for the years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , are presented in the table on the next page. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. "All Other" activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies. FS- -38 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Segment Income Taxes Segment income tax expense for the years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is as follows: Other Segment Information Additional information for the segmentation of major equity affiliates is contained in Note 15, on page FS-40. Information related to properties, plant and equipment by segment is contained in Note 16, on page FS-41. FS- -39 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 15 Investments and Advances Equity in earnings, together with investments in and advances to companies accounted for using the equity method and other investments accounted for at or below cost, is shown in the following table. For certain equity affiliates, Chevron pays its share of some income taxes directly. For such affiliates, the equity in earnings does not include these taxes, which are reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income as “Income tax expense.” * 2014 conformed to 2015 presentation. Descriptions of major affiliates, including significant differences between the company’s carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows: Tengizchevroil Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan. At December 31, 2015 , the company’s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $150 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO’s net assets. See Note 8, on page FS-34, for summarized financial information for 100 percent of TCO. Petropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the Hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. At December 31, 2015 , the company’s carrying value of its investment in Petropiar was approximately $160 less than the amount of underlying equity in Petropiar’s net assets. The difference represents the excess of Chevron’s underlying equity in Petropiar’s net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture. Caspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak. The company has investments and advances totaling $1,342 , which includes long-term loans of $1,098 at year-end 2015 . The loans were provided to fund 30 percent of the initial pipeline construction. The company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share of the financial returns. Petroboscan Chevron has a 39.2 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in Venezuela. At December 31, 2015 , the company’s carrying value of its investment in Petroboscan was approximately $140 higher than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net assets. The difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by Chevron over its underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net assets. Angola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets. FS- -40 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts GS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants, predominantly in South Korea. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66. Caltex Australia Ltd. Chevron sold its 50 percent equity ownership interest in Caltex Australia Ltd. (CAL) in second quarter 2015. Other Information “Sales and other operating revenues” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $4,850 , $10,404 and $14,635 with affiliated companies for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. “Purchased crude oil and products” includes $4,240 , $6,735 and $7,063 with affiliated companies for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. “Accounts and notes receivable” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $399 and $924 due from affiliated companies at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. “Accounts payable” includes $286 and $345 due to affiliated companies at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The following table provides summarized financial information on a 100 percent basis for all equity affiliates as well as Chevron’s total share, which includes Chevron's net loans to affiliates of $410 , $874 and $1,129 at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Note 16 Properties, Plant and Equipment 1 FS- -41 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 17 Litigation MTBE Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to seven pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. The company’s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States. Ecuador Background Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpet’s ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a three -year remediation program at a cost of $40 . After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations. Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that Texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuador’s failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and Petroecuador’s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations. Lago Agrio Judgment In 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that the court assess $18,900 , which would, according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for Petroecuador. The engineer’s report also asserted that an additional $8,400 could be assessed against Chevron for unjust enrichment. In 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case was recused. In 2010, Chevron moved to strike the mining engineer’s report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the United States indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineer’s independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct. In August 2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineer’s report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days . Chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement. In September 2010, Chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should be assessed against it. The plaintiffs’ submission, which relied in part on the mining engineer’s report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16,000 and $76,000 and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately $5,000 and $38,000 . The next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. Chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of Chevron’s prior recusal petition, and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved. In October 2010, Chevron’s motion to recuse the judge was granted. A new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judge’s order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. On December 17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. FS- -42 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts On February 14, 2011, the provincial court in Lago Agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case. The court rejected Chevron’s defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion. The judgment assessed approximately $8,600 in damages and approximately $900 as an award for the plaintiffs’ representatives. It also assessed an additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days of the judgment, which Chevron did not do. On February 17, 2011, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment, seeking increased damages, and on March 11, 2011, Chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment nullified. On January 3, 2012, an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the February 14, 2011 decision and ordered that Chevron pay additional attorneys’ fees in the amount of “ 0.10% of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment.” The plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify and amplify the appellate decision on January 6, 2012, and the court issued a ruling in response on January 13, 2012, purporting to clarify and amplify its January 3, 2012 ruling, which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages was within 15 days of the clarification ruling, or February 3, 2012. Chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial. On January 20, 2012, Chevron appealed (called a petition for cassation) the appellate panel’s decision to Ecuador’s National Court of Justice. As part of the appeal, Chevron requested the suspension of any requirement that Chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement under Ecuadorian law of the judgment during the cassation appeal. On February 17, 2012, the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted Chevron’s cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the National Court of Justice to hear the appeal. The provincial court appellate panel denied Chevron’s request for suspension of the requirement that Chevron post a bond and stated that it would not comply with the First and Second Interim Awards of the international arbitration tribunal discussed below. On March 29, 2012, the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the National Court of Justice, and on November 22, 2012, the National Court agreed to hear Chevron's cassation appeal. On August 3, 2012, the provincial court in Lago Agrio approved a court-appointed liquidator’s report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be $19,100 . On November 13, 2013, the National Court ratified the judgment but nullified the $8,600 punitive damage assessment, resulting in a judgment of $9,500 . On December 23, 2013, Chevron appealed the decision to the Ecuador Constitutional Court, Ecuador's highest court. The reporting justice of the Constitutional Court heard oral arguments on the appeal on July 16, 2015. On July 2, 2013, the provincial court in Lago Agrio issued an embargo order in Ecuador ordering that any funds to be paid by the Government of Ecuador to Chevron to satisfy a $96 award issued in an unrelated action by an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law must be paid to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. The award was issued by the tribunal under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty in an action filed in 2006 in connection with seven breach of contract cases that Texpet filed against the Government of Ecuador between 1991 and 1993. The Government of Ecuador has moved to set aside the tribunal's award. On September 26, 2014, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands issued an opinion denying Ecuador’s set aside request. A Federal District Court for the District of Columbia confirmed the tribunal's award, and on August 4, 2015, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. On September 9, 2015, the Court of Appeals denied the Government of Ecuador's request for full appellate court review of the Federal District Court's decision. Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' Enforcement Actions Chevron has no assets in Ecuador and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' lawyers have stated in press releases and through other media that they will seek to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in various countries and otherwise disrupt Chevron's operations. On May 30, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed an action against Chevron Corporation, Chevron Canada Limited, and Chevron Canada Finance Limited in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On May 1, 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that the Court has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action, but stayed the action due to the absence of evidence that Chevron Corporation has assets in Ontario. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed that decision and on December 17, 2013, the Court of Appeals for Ontario affirmed the lower court’s decision on jurisdiction and set aside the stay,  allowing the recognition and enforcement action to be heard in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Chevron appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada and, on September 4, 2015, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action. The recognition and enforcement proceeding and related preliminary motions are proceeding in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. On June 27, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed a complaint against Chevron Corporation in the Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia, Brazil, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. Chevron has answered the complaint. In accordance with Brazilian procedure, the matter was referred to the public prosecutor for a nonbinding opinion of the issues raised in the complaint. On May 13, 2015, the public prosecutor issued its nonbinding opinion and recommended that the Superior Court of Justice reject the plaintiffs' recognition and enforcement request, finding, among other things, that the Lago Agrio judgment was FS- -43 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts procured through fraud and corruption and cannot be recognized in Brazil because it violates Brazilian and international public order. On October 15, 2012, the provincial court in Lago Agrio issued an ex parte embargo order that purports to order the seizure of assets belonging to separate Chevron subsidiaries in Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia. On November 6, 2012, at the request of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, a court in Argentina issued a Freeze Order against Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and another Chevron subsidiary, Ingeniero Norberto Priu, requiring shares of both companies to be "embargoed," requiring third parties to withhold 40 percent of any payments due to Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and ordering banks to withhold 40 percent of the funds in Chevron Argentina S.R.L. bank accounts. On December 14, 2012, the Argentinean court rejected a motion to revoke the Freeze Order but modified it by ordering that third parties are not required to withhold funds but must report their payments. The court also clarified that the Freeze Order relating to bank accounts excludes taxes. On January 30, 2013, an appellate court upheld the Freeze Order, but on June 4, 2013 the Supreme Court of Argentina revoked the Freeze Order in its entirety. On December 12, 2013, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs served Chevron with notice of their filing of an enforcement proceeding in the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina. Chevron filed its answer on February 27, 2014, to which the Lago Agrio plaintiffs responded on December 29, 2015. Chevron continues to believe the provincial court’s judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and other countries. The company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence. Chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in Ecuador or any enforcement action. Chevron expects to continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability in the Ecuadorian courts and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions. Company's Bilateral Investment Treaty Arbitration Claims Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of Ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The claim alleges violations of the Republic of Ecuador’s obligations under the United States–Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet (described above), which are investment agreements protected by the BIT. Through the arbitration, Chevron and Texpet are seeking relief against the Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a violation of Ecuador’s obligations under the BIT. On February 9, 2011, the Tribunal issued an Order for Interim Measures requiring the Republic of Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending further order of the Tribunal. On January 25, 2012, the Tribunal converted the Order for Interim Measures into an Interim Award. Chevron filed a renewed application for further interim measures on January 4, 2012, and the Republic of Ecuador opposed Chevron’s application and requested that the existing Order for Interim Measures be vacated on January 9, 2012. On February 16, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Second Interim Award mandating that the Republic of Ecuador take all measures necessary (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and without Ecuador of the judgment against Chevron and, in particular, to preclude any certification by the Republic of Ecuador that would cause the judgment to be enforceable against Chevron. On February 27, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Third Interim Award confirming its jurisdiction to hear Chevron's arbitration claims. On February 7, 2013, the Tribunal issued its Fourth Interim Award in which it declared that the Republic of Ecuador “has violated the First and Second Interim Awards under the [BIT], the UNCITRAL Rules and international law in regard to the finalization and enforcement subject to execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and outside Ecuador, including (but not limited to) Canada, Brazil and Argentina.” The Republic of Ecuador subsequently filed in the District Court of the Hague a request to set aside the Tribunal’s Interim Awards and the First Partial Award (described below), and on January 20, 2016, the District Court denied the Republic's request. The Tribunal has divided the merits phase of the proceeding into three phases. On September 17, 2013, the Tribunal issued its First Partial Award from Phase One, finding that the settlement agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet applied to Texpet and Chevron, released Texpet and Chevron from claims based on "collective" or "diffuse" rights arising from Texpet's operations in the former concession area and precluded third parties from asserting collective/diffuse rights environmental claims relating to Texpet's operations in the former concession area but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm. The Tribunal held a hearing on April 29-30, 2014, to address remaining issues relating to Phase One, and on March 12, 2015, it issued a nonbinding decision that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' complaint, on its face, includes claims not barred by the settlement agreement between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet. In the same decision, the Tribunal deferred to Phase Two remaining issues from Phase One, including whether the Republic of Ecuador breached the 1995 settlement agreement and the remedies FS- -44 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts that are available to Chevron and Texpet as a result of that breach. Phase Two issues were addressed at a hearing held in April and May 2015. The Tribunal has not set a date for Phase Three, the damages phase of the arbitration. Company's RICO Action Through a series of U.S. court proceedings initiated by Chevron to obtain discovery relating to the Lago Agrio litigation and the BIT arbitration, Chevron obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. In February 2011, Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters, alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws. Through the civil lawsuit, Chevron is seeking relief that includes a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. On March 7, 2011, the Federal District Court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending resolution of Chevron’s civil lawsuit by the Federal District Court. On May 31, 2011, the Federal District Court severed claims one through eight of Chevron’s complaint from the ninth claim for declaratory relief and imposed a discovery stay on claims one through eight pending a trial on the ninth claim for declaratory relief. On September 19, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction, stayed the trial on Chevron’s ninth claim, a claim for declaratory relief, that had been set for November 14, 2011, and denied the defendants’ mandamus petition to recuse the judge hearing the lawsuit. The Second Circuit issued its opinion on January 26, 2012 ordering the dismissal of Chevron’s ninth claim for declaratory relief. On February 16, 2012, the Federal District Court lifted the stay on claims one through eight, and on October 18, 2012, the Federal District Court set a trial date of October 15, 2013. On March 22, 2013, Chevron settled its claims against Stratus Consulting, and on April 12, 2013 sworn declarations by representatives of Stratus Consulting were filed with the Court admitting their role and that of the plaintiffs' attorneys in drafting the environmental report of the mining engineer appointed by the provincial court in Lago Agrio. On September 26, 2013, the Second Circuit denied the defendants' Petition for Writ of Mandamus to recuse the judge hearing the case and to collaterally estop Chevron from seeking a declaration that the Lago Agrio judgment was obtained through fraud and other unlawful conduct. The trial commenced on October 15, 2013 and concluded on November 22, 2013. On March 4, 2014, the Federal District Court entered a judgment in favor of Chevron, prohibiting the defendants from seeking to enforce the Lago Agrio judgment in the United States and further prohibiting them from profiting from their illegal acts. The defendants appealed the Federal District Court's decision, and, on April 20, 2015, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral arguments. Management's Assessment The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects associated with the Ecuadorian judgment, the 2008 engineer’s report on alleged damages and the September 2010 plaintiffs’ submission on alleged damages, management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Note 18 Taxes FS- -45 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts In 2015 , before-tax loss for U.S. operations, including related corporate and other charges, was $(2,877) , compared with before-tax income of $6,296 and $4,672 in 2014 and 2013 , respectively. For international operations, before-tax income was $7,719 , $24,906 and $31,233 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. U.S. federal income tax expense was reduced by $35 , $68 and $175 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, for business tax credits. The reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the company’s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table: 1 2013 and 2014 conformed to 2015 presentation. 2 2015 includes one-time tax benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions and provision-to-return adjustments. The company’s effective tax rate decreased from 38.1 percent in 2014 to 2.7 percent in 2015 . The decrease primarily resulted from the impacts of jurisdictional mix, one-time tax benefits, foreign currency remeasurement, equity earnings and a reduction in statutory tax rates in the United Kingdom, partially offset by the effects of valuation allowances recognized on deferred tax assets and the sale of the company's interest in Caltex Australia Limited. The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and classifies those net amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets or liabilities. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following: Deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2015 decreased by approximately $700 from year-end 2014 . The decrease was primarily related to decreased temporary differences related to property, plant and equipment. Deferred tax assets were essentially unchanged between periods. A reduction in U.S. foreign tax credits was substantially offset by an increase in foreign tax loss carryforwards. The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. It reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2015 , the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $7,615 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,249 , primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2016 through 2025 . U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $10,534 will expire between 2017 and 2024 . FS- -46 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $45,400 at December 31, 2015 . This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. At the end of 2015 , deferred income taxes were recorded for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations where indefinite reinvestment of the earnings is not planned. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent ) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. The following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits between December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the resolution of numerous audit issues with various tax jurisdictions during the year. Approximately 71 percent of the $3,042 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 , would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition. Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2015 . For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States – 2011 , Nigeria – 2000 , Angola – 2009 , Saudi Arabia – 2012 and Kazakhstan – 2007 . The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits. FS- -47 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “Income tax expense.” As of December 31, 2015 , accruals of $399 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accruals of $233 as of year-end 2014 . Income tax expense (benefit) associated with interest and penalties was $195 , $4 and $(42) in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Taxes Other Than on Income Note 19 Short-Term Debt Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date. The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2015 , the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt. At December 31, 2015 , the company had $8,000 in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities consist of a 364 -day facility which enables borrowing of up to $6,000 and can be renewed for an additional 364 -day period or the company can convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, and a $2,000 five -year facility expiring in December 2020 . These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2015 . At both December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the company classified $8,000 of short-term debt as long-term. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. FS- -48 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 20 Long-Term Debt Total long-term debt, excluding capital leases, at December 31, 2015 , was $33,584 . The company’s long-term debt outstanding at year-end 2015 and 2014 was as follows: Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2018. This registration statement is for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company. Long-term debt of $27,071 matures as follows: 2016 – $1,487 ; 2017 – $6,187 ; 2018 – $5,836 ; 2019 – $2,650 ; 2020 – $4,054 ; and after 2020 – $6,857 . The company completed bond issuances of $6,000 and $5,000 in March and November 2015, respectively. See Note 9, beginning on page FS-34, for information concerning the fair value of the company’s long-term debt. Note 21 Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and (b) the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. FS- -49 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31, 2015 : * Represents property sales. The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling. * Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both. Of the $2,823 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2015 , $1,662 ( 20 projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities under way or firmly planned for the near future. The $1,161 balance is related to 19 projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not under way or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development. The projects for the $1,161 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability: (a) $190 ( two projects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years ; (b) $99 ( one project) – development concept under review by government; (c) $814 ( seven projects) – development alternatives under review; (d) $58 ( nine projects) – miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended. While progress was being made on all 39 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. Approximately half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years . The $2,823 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2015 , represents 165 exploratory wells in 39 projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis: Note 22 Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation Compensation expense for stock options for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $312 ( $203 after tax), $287 ( $186 after tax) and $292 ( $190 after tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance units and restricted stock units was $32 ( $21 after tax), $71 ( $46 after tax) and $223 ( $145 after tax) for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at December 31, 2015 , or December 31, 2014 . FS- -50 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $195 , $527 and $553 , respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $17 , $54 and $73 for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was $104 , $204 and $186 for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Awards under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May 2023, no more than 260 million shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than 50 million of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance units and restricted stock units, and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. Remaining awards under the Unocal Share-Based Plans expired in early 2015. The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions: 1 Expected term is based on historical exercise and postvesting cancellation data. 2 Volatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate period, generally equal to the expected term. A summary of option activity during 2015 is presented below: The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $120 , $398 and $445 , respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these awards. As of December 31, 2015 , there was $190 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. At January 1, 2015 , the number of LTIP performance units outstanding was equivalent to 2,265,952 shares. During 2015 , 890,000 units were granted, 828,868 units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 134,147 units were forfeited. At December 31, 2015 , units outstanding were 2,192,937 . The fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $166 , and was measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method. In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various LTIP programs totaled approximately 4.5 million equivalent shares as of December 31, 2015 . A liability of $51 was recorded for these awards. Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations FS- -51 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives. The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. Medical coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees in the company’s main U.S. medical plan is secondary to Medicare (including Part D) and the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company. The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status of the company’s pension and OPEB plans for 2015 and 2014 follows: Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the company’s pension and OPEB plans at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , include: Amounts recognized on a before-tax basis in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and OPEB plans were $6,478 and $7,417 at the end of 2015 and 2014 , respectively. These amounts consisted of: FS- -52 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The accumulated benefit obligations for all U.S. and international pension plans were $12,032 and $4,684 , respectively, at December 31, 2015 , and $12,833 and $4,995 , respectively, at December 31, 2014 . Information for U.S. and international pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , was: The components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are shown in the table below: Net actuarial losses recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at December 31, 2015 , for the company’s U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans are being amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately 10 , 10 and 16 years, respectively. These amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. During 2016 , the company estimates actuarial losses of $335 , $56 and $19 will be amortized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. In addition, the company estimates an additional $324 will be recognized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” during 2016 related to lump-sum settlement costs from the main U.S. pension plan. The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at December 31, 2015 , was approximately 4 and 11 years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, and 7 years for OPEB plans. During 2016 , the company estimates prior service (credits) costs of $(9) , $15 and $14 will be amortized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. FS- -53 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Assumptions The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31: Expected Return on Plan Assets The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. For 2015 , the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.5 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 71 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In both 2014 and 2013 , the company used a long-term rate of return of 7.5 percent for this plan. The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three -month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company's plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. At December 31, 2015 , the projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis were 4.0 percent for the main U.S. pension plan and 4.5 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for these plans at the end of 2014 were 3.7 and 4.1 percent , respectively, while in 2013 they were 4.3 and 4.7 percent for these plans, respectively. The company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest costs associated with the company’s main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. In prior years, the service and interest costs were estimated utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year. Under the new method, these costs are estimated by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The change was made to provide a more precise measurement of the service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change in accounting estimate is accounted for prospectively beginning with the year ending December 31, 2016. The company does not expect the change to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Other Benefit Assumptions For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 , for the main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.1 percent in 2016 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2014 , the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 7 percent in 2015 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. In both measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4 percent . Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs. The impact is mitigated by the 4 percent cap on the company’s medical contributions for the main U.S. plan. A 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans: FS- -54 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Plan Assets and Investment Strategy The fair value measurements of the company’s pension plans for 2015 and 2014 are below: FS- -55 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts The effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in Level 3 plan assets are outlined below: The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management. The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 91 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans’ investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established. For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company's Benefit Plan Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities 40 – 70 percent , Fixed Income and Cash 20 – 60 percent , Real Estate 0 – 15 percent , and Other 0 – 5 percent . For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines: Equities 30 – 50 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 35 – 65 percent , and Real Estate 5 – 15 percent. The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset class risk. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds. The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations. Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2015 , the company contributed $641 and $227 to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2016 , the company expects contributions to be approximately $650 to its U.S. plans and $250 to its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. The company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $191 in 2016 ; $196 was paid in 2015 . The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years: FS- -56 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Employee Savings Investment Plan Eligible employees of Chevron and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP). Compensation expense for the ESIP totaled $316 , $316 and $163 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The amount for ESIP expense in 2013 is net of $140 , which reflects the value of common stock released from the former leveraged employee stock ownership plan (LESOP). LESOP debt was retired in 2013, and all remaining shares were released. Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2015 , the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations. Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , trust assets of $36 and $38 , respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts. Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $690 , $965 and $871 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 22, beginning on page FS-50. Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 18, beginning on page FS-45, for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or subject to future examination. Guarantees The company’s guarantee of $447 is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 12 -year remaining term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee. Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200 , which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997. Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum FS- -57 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2016 – $2,100 ; 2017 – $1,900 ; 2018 – $1,700 ; 2019 – $1,500 ; 2020 – $1,100 ; 2020 and after – $3,100 . A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $1,900 in 2015 , $3,700 in 2014 and $3,600 in 2013 . Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining sites. Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2015 , was $1,578 . Included in this balance were $348 related to remediation activities at approximately 163 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. Of the remaining year-end 2015 environmental reserves balance of $1,230 , $845 is related to the company’s U.S. downstream operations, $58 to its international downstream operations, $323 to upstream operations and $4 to  other businesses. Liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2015 had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. Refer to Note 25 on page FS-59 for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations. Other Contingencies On November 7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater Frade Field about 75 miles offshore Brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. The source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned. On March 14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field. No evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to either of these seeps emerged. As reported in the company’s previously filed periodic reports, it has resolved civil claims relating to these incidents brought by a Brazilian federal district prosecutor. As also reported previously, the federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against Chevron and 11 Chevron employees. These charges were dismissed by the trial court on February 19, 2013, reinstated by an appellate court on October 9, 2013, and then, upon Chevron’s motion for reconsideration, dismissed by the appellate court on August 27, 2015. The federal district prosecutor has appealed the appellate court’s decision. Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods. The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. FS- -58 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) as an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates. AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation. The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : In the table above, the amounts associated with "Revisions in estimated cash flows" generally reflect increased cost estimates to abandon wells, equipment and facilities and accelerated timing of abandonment. The long-term portion of the $15,642 balance at the end of 2015 was $14,892 . Note 26 Restructuring and Reorganization Costs In 2015, the company recorded accruals and adjustments for employee reduction programs related to the restructuring and reorganization of its corporate staffs and certain upstream operations.  The employee reductions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2016. A before-tax charge of $ 353 ($ 223 after-tax) was recorded in 2015, with $ 219 reported as “Operating Expenses” and $ 134 reported as "Selling, general and administrative expense" on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The accrued liability, covering severance benefits, is classified as current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Approximately $ 134 ($ 87 after-tax) is associated with employee reductions in All Other, $ 113 ($ 73 after-tax) in U.S. Upstream and $ 106 ($ 63 after-tax) in International Upstream. During 2015, the company made payments of $60 million associated with these liabilities. The following table summarizes the accrued severance liability, which is classified as current on the Consolidated Balance Sheet: Note 27 Other Financial Information Earnings in 2015 included after-tax gains of approximately $2,300 relating to the sale of nonstrategic properties. Of this amount, approximately $1,800 and $500 related to downstream and upstream, respectively. Earnings in 2014 included after-tax gains of approximately $3,000 relating to the sale of nonstrategic properties, of which approximately $1,800 and $ 1,000 related to upstream and downstream assets, respectively. Earnings in 2015 included after-tax charges of approximately $3,000 for impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream. Earnings in 2014 included after-tax charges of approximately $1,000 for impairments and other asset write-offs, of which $ 800 was related to upstream and $200 to a mining asset. FS- -59 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts Other financial information is as follows: * Includes $344 , $118 and $244 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, for the company’s share of equity affiliates’ foreign currency effects. The company has $4,588 in goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to the 2005 acquisition of Unocal and to the 2011 acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. The company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2015 and concluded no impairment was necessary. Five-Year Financial Summary Unaudited FS- -60 Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited In accordance with FASB and SEC disclosure requirements for oil and gas producing activities, this section provides supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and producing activities of the company in seven separate tables. Tables I through IV provide historical cost information pertaining to costs incurred in exploration, property acquisitions and development; capitalized costs; and results of operations.

The system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate. Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. FS- -65 Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Corporate Reserves, a corporate department that is separate from the Upstream operating organization. The Manager of Corporate Reserves has more than 30 years’ experience working in the oil and gas industry and a Master of Science in Petroleum Engineering degree from Stanford University. His experience includes more than 15 years of managing oil and gas reserves processes. He was chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee, served on the United Nations Expert Group on Resources Classification, and is a past member of the Joint Committee on Reserves Evaluator Training and the California Conservation Committee. He is an active member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and serves on the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Corporate Reserves Manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves. During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’s Strategy and Planning Committee, whose members include the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board. RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Corporate Reserves Manual. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2015, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates. Proved Undeveloped Reserves At the end of 2015, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 4.3 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE), a decrease of 687 million BOE from year-end 2014. The decrease was due to the transfer of 1,027 million BOE to proved developed and 2 million BOE in sales, partially offset by increases of 273 million BOE in extensions and discoveries, 65 million BOE in revisions, and 4 million BOE in improved recovery. During 2015, investments totaling approximately $14.3 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $2.3 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. Australia accounted for about $6.4 billion of the total, mainly for development and construction activities at the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects. Expenditures of about $2.7 billion in the United States related primarily to various development activities in the Gulf of Mexico and the midcontinent region. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately $3.2 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, and in Thailand. In Africa, about $2.8 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of the Congo. Development activities in Canada were primarily responsible for about $1.5 billion of expenditures in Other Americas. Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels. FS- -66 Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited At year-end 2015, the company held approximately 2.2 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 500 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to the Gorgon Project. The company is currently constructing liquefaction and other facilities in Australia to develop this natural gas. In Africa, approximately 400 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 1.1 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related to the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion. Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2015, significant reductions in commodity prices negatively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved reserve decreases, and positively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects. The year-end reserves volumes have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections. For 2015, this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 38 percent and 46 percent. The consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period. Proved Reserve Quantities For the three years ending December 31, 2015, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest. At December 31, 2015, proved reserves for the company were 11.2 billion BOE. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 are shown in the table on page FS-68. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page FS-69. Noteworthy changes in liquids proved reserves for 2013 through 2015 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page: Revisions In 2013, improved field performance from various Nigeria and Angola producing assets was primarily responsible for the 94 million barrel increase in Africa. In Asia, drilling performance across numerous assets resulted in an 84 million barrel increase. Improved field performance and drilling associated with Gulf of Mexico projects and drilling in the Midland and Delaware basins accounted for the majority of the 55 million barrel increase in the United States. Synthetic oil reserves in Canada increased by 40 million barrels, primarily due to improved field performance. In 2014, drilling in the Midland and Delaware basins and improved field performance and drilling in California accounted for the majority of the 90 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field performance at various Nigeria fields was primarily responsible for the 74 million barrel increase in Africa. In Asia, drilling performance across numerous assets, primarily in Indonesia, resulted in the 80 million barrel increase. In 2015, entitlement effects and improved performance were responsible for the163 million barrel increase in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. In Asia, entitlement effects and drilling performance across numerous assets resulted in the 164 million barrel increase.  Improved field performance at various Nigerian fields, including Agbami, was primarily responsible for the 60 million barrel increase in Africa.  Synthetic oil reserves in Canada increased by 80 million barrels, primarily due to entitlement effects. Improved Recovery In 2013, improved recovery increased reserves by 57 million barrels due to numerous small projects, including expansions of existing projects in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa. In 2014, improved recovery increased reserves by 34 million barrels, primarily due to secondary recovery projects in the United States, mostly related to steamflood expansions in California. Extensions and Discoveries In 2013, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 55 million barrel increase in the United States. FS- -67 Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited In 2014, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico were primarily responsible for the 164 million barrel increase in the United States. In 2015, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 137 million barrel increase in the United States. Purchases In 2014, the purchase of additional reserves in Canada was responsible for the 26 million barrel increase in synthetic oil. Sales In 2014, the sale of the company’s interests in Chad was responsible for the 20 million barrel decrease in Africa. Net Proved Reserves of Crude Oil, Condensate, Natural Gas Liquids and Synthetic Oil FS- -68 Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited Net Proved Reserves of Natural Gas Noteworthy changes in natural gas proved reserves for 2013 through 2015 are discussed below and shown in the table above: Revisions In 2013, net revisions of 627 BCF in Asia were primarily due to development drilling and improved field performance in Bangladesh and Thailand. In Australia, drilling performance drove the 229 BCF increase. The majority of the net decrease of 234 BCF in the United States was due to a change in development plans in the Appalachian region. In 2014, net revisions of 775 BCF in Australia were primarily due to development drilling at Gorgon. In 2015, positive drilling performance at Wheatstone and Gorgon was responsible for the 974 BCF increase in Australia. Net revisions of 480 BCF in Asia were primarily due to improved field performance in Thailand and to entitlement effects and improved performance in Kazakhstan. The majority of the net decrease of 435 BCF in Other Americas was due to the deferral of the infill drilling and compression projects as well as drilling results in Trinidad and Tobago. The 218 BCF increase for the TCO affiliate was due to entitlement effects and improved performance. Extensions and Discoveries In 2013, extensions and discoveries of 951 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region. In 2014, extensions and discoveries of 614 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region and the Delaware Basin. In 2015, exte nsions and discoveries of 659 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Appalachian region and the Midland and Delaware basins. FS- -69 Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent  management’s estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption “Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. FS- -70 Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited Table VII - Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves The changes in present values between years, which can be significant, reflect changes in estimated proved-reserve quantities and prices and assumptions used in forecasting production volumes and costs. Changes in the timing of production are included with “Revisions of previous quantity estimates.” 1 2013 conformed to 2014 and 2015 presentation.

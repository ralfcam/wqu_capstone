Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries (Schlumberger) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of Schlumberger management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement have been included in the accompanying unaudited financial statements.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  Operating results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2018.  The December 31, 2017 balance sheet information has been derived from the Schlumberger 2017 audited financial statements.  For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Schlumberger Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 24, 2018. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .  This ASU amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition and requires companies to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  Schlumberger adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.   Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reflected in accordance with Schlumberger’s historical accounting.  The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on Schlumberger’s Consolidated Financial Statements . Schlumberger recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for these products or services.  The vast majority of Schlumberger’s services and product offerings are short-term in nature.  The time between invoicing and when payment is due under these arrangements is generally 30 to 60 days. Revenue is occasionally generated from contractual arrangements that include multiple performance obligations.  Revenue from these arrangements is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.  Standalone selling prices are generally based on the prices charged to customers or using expected costs plus margin. Revenue is recognized for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time.  These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications.  Revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract.  Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs.  The estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project.  Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims.  Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs may be required as work progresses.  Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of work as stipulated in the contract.  Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they became probable. Revenue in excess of billings related to contracts where revenue is recognized over time was $0.3 billion at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  Such amounts are included within Receivables less allowance for doubtful accounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . Due to the nature of its business Schlumberger does not have significant backlog.  Total backlog was $2.8 billion at March 31, 2018, of which approximately 50% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Billings and cash collections in excess of revenue was $0.9 billion at March 31, 2018 and $0.8 billion at December 31, 2017.  Such amounts are included within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases .  This ASU requires lessees to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases.  This ASU is effective for Schlumberger on 8 January 1, 2019 , with early adopt ion permitted .  Based on its current lease portfolio, Schlumberger estimates that the adoption of this ASU will result in approximately $1.3 billion of additional assets and liabilities being reflected on its Consolidated Balance Sheet . 2. Charges and Credits 2018 There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2018. 2017 In connection with Schlumberger’s acquisition of Cameron International Corporation (“Cameron”), Schlumberger recorded $82 million of charges during the first quarter of 2017 relating to employee benefits, facility closures and other merger and integration-related costs.  These charges are classified in Merger & integration in the Consolidated Statement of Income . On December 22, 2017, the US enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”).  The Act, which is also commonly referred to as “US tax reform”, significantly changes US corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the US corporate income tax rate to 21% starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of US subsidiaries.  As a result, Schlumberger recorded a net charge of $76 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.  This amount consisted of two components: (i) a $410 million charge relating to the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of certain non-US subsidiaries that are owned either wholly or partially by a US subsidiary of Schlumberger, and (ii) a $334 million credit resulting from the remeasurement of Schlumberger’s net deferred tax liabilities in the US based on the new lower corporate income tax rate. Although the $76 million net charge represents a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the Act on Schlumberger’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017, it should be considered provisional. Once Schlumberger finalizes certain tax positions when it files its 2017 US tax return, it will be able to conclude whether any further adjustments are required. Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of Taxes on income in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018. 3. Earnings Per Share The following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per share of Schlumberger to diluted earnings per share of Schlumberger: The number of outstanding options to purchase shares of Schlumberger common stock that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect, was as follows: 9 4. Inventories A summary of inventories, which are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, follows: 5. Fixed Assets A summary of fixed assets follows: Depreciation expense relating to fixed assets was $523 million and $613 million in first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. 6. Multiclient Seismic Data The change in the carrying amount of multiclient seismic data for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was as follows: 7. Intangible Assets The gross book value, accumulated amortization and net book value of intangible assets were as follows: 10 Amortization expense charged to income was $ 165 million during the first quarter of 2018 and $169 million during the fist quarter of 2017. Based on the net book value of intangible assets at March 31, 2018, amortization charged to income for the subsequent five years is estimated to be: remaining three quarters of 2018—$519 million; 2019—$672 million; 2020—$640 million; 2021—$617 million; 2022—$607 million; and 2023—$594 million. 8. Long-term Debt A summary of Long-term Debt follows: The estimated fair value of Schlumberger’s Long-term Debt, based on quoted market prices at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $13.6 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively. Borrowings under Schlumberger’s commercial paper programs at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $3.0 billion, of which $1.3 billion was classified in Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . 9. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Schlumberger is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  To mitigate these risks, Schlumberger utilizes derivative instruments.  Schlumberger does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio.  Schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio, and occasionally interest rate swaps, to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates. During 2013, Schlumberger entered into a cross-currency swap for a notional amount of €0.5 billion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of Schlumberger’s €0.5 billion 1.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2019.  Under the terms of this swap, Schlumberger will receive 11 interest at a fixed rate of 1.50% on the euro notional amount and pay interest at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus appr oximately 64 basis points on the US dollar notional amount. This cross-currency swap is designated as a fair value hedge of the underlying debt and is marked to market, with gains and losses recognized immediately in income to largely offset the effects on changes in the fair value of the hedged debt. During 2017, a Canadian dollar functional currency subsidiary of Schlumberger issued $1.1 billion of US dollar denominated debt.  Schlumberger entered into cross-currency swaps for an aggregate notional amount of $1.1 billion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of its $0.5 billion 2.20% Senior Notes due 2020 and its $0.6 billion 2.65% Senior Notes due 2022. These cross-currency swaps effectively convert the US dollar notes to Canadian dollar denominated debt with fixed annual interest rates of 1.97% and 2.52%, respectively. These cross-currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair values of the hedges are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Amounts recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss are reclassified to earnings in the same periods that the underlying hedged item affects net income. At March 31, 2018, Schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating $13.6 billion and variable rate debt aggregating $4.5 billion, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps. Short-term investments were $2.3 billion at March 31, 2018.  The carrying value of these investments approximated fair value. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As a multinational company, Schlumberger conducts its business in over 85 countries. Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar.  However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies.  Therefore, when the US dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase (decrease). Schlumberger is exposed to risks on future cash flows to the extent that the local currency is not the functional currency and expenses denominated in local currency are not equal to revenues denominated in local currency.  Schlumberger is also exposed to risks on future cash flows relating to certain of its fixed rate debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against a portion of these cash flow risks.  These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the changes in the fair value of the hedge recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Amounts recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. At March 31, 2018, Schlumberger recognized a cumulative net $5 million gain in Accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to revaluation of foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, the majority of which is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. At March 31, 2018, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $5.0 billion in various foreign currencies, of which $1.8 billion relates to hedges of debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. 12 The effect of derivative instruments designated as fair value and cash flow hedges , and those not designated as hedges , on the Conso lidated Statement of Income was as follows: 10. Contingencies Schlumberger and its subsidiaries are party to various legal proceedings from time to time.  A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Management believes that the probability of a material loss with respect to any currently pending legal proceeding is remote.  However, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of any of these proceedings. 11.

First Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017 (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income ($3 million in 2018; $5 million in 2017). (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income ($12 million in 2018; $13 million in 2017). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . First-quarter 2018 revenue of $7.8 billion increased 14% year-on-year as the global rig count increased by the same percentage. The North America land rig count increased by 21% year-on-year, while the international rig count was up 8%. Production Group revenue increased 35% while Drilling Group revenue increased by 7%, both driven by strong land activity in North America. Cameron Group revenue increased by 7%, while Reservoir Characterization Group revenue declined 4%. First-quarter 2018 pretax operating margin increased 145 basis points (“bps”) year-on-year to 12%, as a result of improved profitability in North America due to the land activity growth that benefited the Production and Drilling Groups.  As a result, Production Group pretax operating margin expanded 227 bps to 7% and the Drilling Group increased 222 bps to 14%.  Reservoir Characterization Group pretax operating margin increased 240 bps to 20% while the Cameron Group was essentially flat at 13%. Reservoir Characterization Group First-quarter 2018 revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 4% year-on-year primarily due to lower revenue on a long-term surface facility project in the Middle East. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 240 bps to 20% due to improved profitability for WesternGeco primarily as a result of a favorable mix of multiclient seismic license sales as well as reduced amortization following the multiclient impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. Drilling Group First-quarter 2018 revenue of $2.1 billion increased 7% year-on-year primarily due to higher demand for directional drilling technologies on land in both North America and Russia. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 222 bps to 14% primarily due to improved profitability in North America due to the increased land activity and improved pricing. 16 Production Group First-quarter 2018 revenue of $3.0 billion increased 35% year-on-year primarily due to the significant land activity growth in North America that benefited the hydraulic fracturing business. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 227 bps to 7% as a result of improved profitability in North America due to the growth in North America land activity combined with improved pricing. During the first quarter of 2018, the US land pressure pumping business was impacted by weaker-than-expected activity as well as softer pricing as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017,  rising supply chain costs, and rail logistical challenges. In spite of these factors, Schlumberger continued to deploy available fracturing assets, including equipment from our newly acquired capacity. Schlumberger expects the US land hydraulic fracturing market to improve during the second quarter of 2018, both in terms of pricing and in operational efficiency and it is, therefore continuing with its aggressive fleet reactivation and recommissioning program. Cameron Group First-quarter 2018 revenue of $1.3 billion increased 7% year-on-year due to improvements on land in North America that benefited the short-cycle businesses of Valves & Measurement and Surface Systems. Pretax operating margin of 13% was essentially flat year-on-year. Interest and Other Income Interest & other income consisted of the following: Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue , for the first quarter of both 2018 and 2017 were as follows: Research & engineering costs for the first quarter of 2018 have decreased as compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of cost control measures. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 17.6% as compared to 14.8% for the same period of 2017.  The effective tax rate increased as a result of the change in the geographic mix of earnings, as Schlumberger generated a greater portion of its pretax earnings in North America during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period last year. Charges and Credits 2018 There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2018. 2017 In connection with Schlumberger’s acquisition of Cameron, Schlumberger recorded $82 million of charges relating to  employee benefits, facility closures and other merger and integration-related costs.  These charges are classified in Merger & integration in the Consolidated Statement of Income . 17 Liquidity and Capital Resources Details of the components of liquidity as well as changes in liquidity follow: 18 Key liquidity events during the first three months of 201 8 and 201 7 included: The following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase programs: Schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries.   As of December 31, 2017, only five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger’s net receivables balance, of which only one (the United States) accounted for greater than 10% of such receivables. As of March 31, 2018, Schlumberger had $4.2 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand.  Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $6.5 billion that support commercial paper programs, of which $3.5 billion was available and unused.  Schlumberger believes these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Borrowings under the commercial paper programs at March 31, 2018 were $3.0 billion.

Item 5. Other Information. In 2013, Schlumberger completed the wind-down of its service operations in Iran. Prior to this, certain non-US subsidiaries provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates (“NIOC”). Schlumberger’s residual transactions or dealings with the government of Iran during the first quarter of 2018 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges. Certain non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger maintain depository accounts at the Dubai branch of Bank Saderat Iran (“Saderat”), and at Bank Tejarat (“Tejarat”) in Tehran and in Kish for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran and for the maintenance of such amounts previously received. One non-US subsidiary also maintains an account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes. Schlumberger anticipates that it will discontinue dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran. 21 Item 6.

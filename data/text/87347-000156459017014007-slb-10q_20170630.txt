Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries (Schlumberger) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of Schlumberger management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement have been included in the accompanying unaudited financial statements.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  Operating results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2017.  The December 31, 2016 balance sheet information has been derived from the Schlumberger 2016 audited financial statements.  For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Schlumberger Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 25, 2017. New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .  This ASU amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition and is based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  Schlumberger will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2018.  Schlumberger does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases .  This ASU requires lessees to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases.  Schlumberger will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019.  Based on its current lease portfolio, Schlumberger estimates that the adoption of this ASU will result in approximately $1.3 billion of additional assets and liabilities being reflected on its Consolidated Balance Sheet . 2. Charges and Credits Schlumberger recorded the following charges and credits during the first six months of 2017: Second quarter 2017: During the second quarter of 2017, Schlumberger also entered into discussions with another customer relating to certain of its outstanding accounts receivable.  As a result of these ongoing discussions, Schlumberger recorded a pretax charge of $50 million ($38 million after taxes and noncontrolling interests) to adjust these receivables to their estimated net realizable value. These charges are classified in Impairments & other in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). First quarter of 2017: 8 The following is a summary of the charges and credits recorded during the first six months of 2017: Schlumberger recorded the following charges and credits during the second quarter of 2016: The fair value of the impaired fixed assets and multiclient seismic data was estimated based on the projected present value of future cash flows that these assets are expected to generate.  Such estimates included unobservable inputs that required significant judgments.  Additional charges may be required in future periods should industry conditions worsen.  The above items are classified in Impairments & other in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) . 9 The following is a summary of the charges and credits recorded during the second quarter of 2016 : There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2016. 3. Earnings Per Share The following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per share of Schlumberger to diluted earnings per share of Schlumberger: The number of outstanding options to purchase shares of Schlumberger common stock that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect, was as follows: 10 4. Acquisition of Cameron On April 1, 2016, Schlumberger acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cameron, a leading provider of flow equipment products, systems and services to the oil and gas industry worldwide. Schlumberger issued approximately 138 million shares of its common stock, which were valued at $9.9 billion at the time of closing, and paid cash of $2.8 billion.  Prior to being acquired by Schlumberger, Cameron reported revenue of approximately $1.6 billion during the first quarter of 2016. Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information The following supplemental pro forma results of operations assume that Cameron had been acquired as of January 1, 2015.  The supplemental pro forma financial information was prepared based on the historical financial information of Schlumberger and Cameron and has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that are both directly attributable to the transaction and factually supportable.  The pro forma amounts reflect certain adjustments to intangible asset amortization expense, interest and income taxes resulting from purchasing accounting.  The pro forma amounts also reflect adjustments to the 2016 results to exclude the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with the write-up of acquired inventory to its estimated fair value and  other merger and integration costs of $254 million, net of taxes, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. The supplemental pro forma financial information presented below does not include any anticipated cost savings or the expected realization of other synergies associated with this transaction.  Accordingly, this supplemental pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have been had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015, nor is it indicative of future results of operations. 5. Inventories A summary of inventories, which are stated at the lower of average cost or market, follows: 11 6. Fixed Assets A summary of fixed assets follows: Depreciation expense relating to fixed assets was as follows: 7. Multiclient Seismic Data The change in the carrying amount of multiclient seismic data for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was as follows: 8. Intangible Assets The gross book value, accumulated amortization and net book value of intangible assets were as follows: Amortization expense charged to income was as follows: Based on the net book value of intangible assets at June 30, 2017, amortization charged to income for the subsequent five years is estimated to be: remaining two quarters of 2017—$350 million; 2018—$681 million; 2019—$668 million; 2020—$621 million; 2021—$597 million; and 2022—$586 million. 12 9 . Long-term Debt A summary of Long-term Debt follows: The estimated fair value of Schlumberger’s Long-term Debt, based on quoted market prices at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, was $16.9 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively. Borrowings under the commercial paper program at June 30, 2017 were $3.0 billion, of which $2.8 billion was classified within Long-term Debt and $0.2 billion was classified within Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet .  At December 31, 2016, borrowings under the commercial paper program were $2.6 billion, of which $2.4 billion was classified within Long-term debt and $0.2 billion was classified in Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet . 10. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Schlumberger is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  To mitigate these risks, Schlumberger utilizes derivative instruments.  Schlumberger does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio.  Schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio, and occasionally interest rate swaps, to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates. During 2013, Schlumberger entered into a cross currency swap for a notional amount of €0.5 billion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of Schlumberger’s €0.5 billion 1.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2019.  Under the terms of this swap, Schlumberger will receive interest at a fixed rate of 1.50% on the euro notional amount and pay interest at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus approximately 64 basis points on the US dollar notional amount. This cross currency swap is designated as a fair value hedge of the underlying debt.  This derivative instrument is marked to market with gains and losses recognized currently in income to largely offset the respective gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of the hedged debt. 13 At June 30 , 201 7 , Schlumberger had fixed rate debt of $ 13.9 billion and variable rate debt of $ 4. 9 billion after taking into account the effect of the swap. Short-term investments and Fixed income investments , held to maturity totaled $4.3 billion at June 30, 2017.  The carrying value of these investments approximated fair value, which was estimated using quoted market prices for those or similar investments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As a multinational company, Schlumberger conducts its business in over 85 countries. Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar.  However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies.  Therefore, when the US dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar–reported expenses will increase (decrease). Schlumberger is exposed to risks on future cash flows to the extent that the local currency is not the functional currency and expenses denominated in local currency are not equal to revenues denominated in local currency.  Schlumberger is also exposed to risks on future cash flows relating to certain of its fixed rate debt that is denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against a portion of these cash flow risks.  These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedge recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Amounts recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments, if any, is recorded directly to earnings. At June 30, 2017, Schlumberger recognized a cumulative net loss of $0.1 million in Accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to revaluation of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options designated as cash flow hedges, the majority of which is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. Schlumberger is exposed to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  While Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to economically hedge this exposure as it relates to certain currencies, these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  Instead, the fair value of the contracts is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and changes in the fair value are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) as are changes in fair value of the hedged item. At June 30, 2017, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $4.8 billion in various foreign currencies, of which $0.8 billion related to hedges of debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The fair values of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows: 14 The fair value of all outstanding derivatives was determined using a model with inputs that are observable in the market or that can be derived from, or corroborated by, observable data. The effect of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and those not designated as hedges on the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) was as follows: 11. Contingencies Schlumberger is party to various legal proceedings from time to time.  A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Management believes that the probability of a material loss with respect to any currently pending legal proceeding is remote.  However, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of any of these proceedings. 15 1 2 .

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Second Quarter 2017 Compared to First Quarter 2017 (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income ($6 million in the second quarter of 2017; $5 million in the first quarter of 2017). (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income ($14 million in the second quarter of 2017; $13 million in the first quarter of 2017). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Reservoir Characterization Group Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $1.8 billion increased 9% sequentially primarily due to higher WesternGeco multiclient seismic license sales in the international markets.  Increased Testing & Process activity in the international markets and seasonal improvements in Wireline in Russia also contributed to the increase. Pretax operating margin of 17% was essentially flat sequentially as the increased contribution from high-margin Wireline exploration activities was offset by reduced profitability in Testing & Process due to increased project costs. Drilling Group Drilling Group revenue of $2.1 billion increased 6% sequentially primarily due to the seasonal rebound in activity in the Russia & CIS and North Sea regions and strong directional drilling activity in US land. Pretax operating margin of 14% increased 278 basis points (bps) sequentially due to increased volume and pricing improvements in US land. Production Group Production Group revenue of $2.5 billion was 14% higher sequentially as a result of strong hydraulic fracturing activity and a sustained pricing recovery in North America. Pretax operating margin of 9% increased 382 bps sequentially due to the increased activity and pricing recovery on land in North America. 19 Cameron Group Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion increased 3% sequentially driven by higher Surface Systems and Valves & Measurement activity in US land. Pretax operating margin of 14% improved 61 bps sequentially as increased project volumes and product sales in Surface Systems and Valves & Measurement and continued strong project execution in OneSubsea more than offset the impact of lower project activity in Drilling Systems. Second Quarter 2017 Compared to Second Quarter 2016 (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income ($6 million in 2017; $6 million in 2016). (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income ($14 million in 2017; $13 million in 2016). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Certain prior period items have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Second-quarter 2017 revenue of $7.5 billion increased 4% year-on-year. North America land rig count increased more than 150% versus the same period last year while the international land rig count was flat. The North America offshore rig count decreased by 26%, and the international offshore rig count was lower by 12%. Driven by the accelerated land activity growth in North America, Production Group revenue increased 18% year-on-year while Reservoir Characterization Group revenue was 11% higher driven by increases in WesternGeco and Testing & Process.  Drilling Group revenue increased by 4% while Cameron Group revenue declined 17%. Second-quarter 2017 pretax operating margin increased 231 bps to 13%, as a result of improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity growth that benefited the Production and Drilling Groups.  As a result, Production Group pretax operating margin expanded 499 bps to 9% while Drilling Group increased 594 bps to 14%.  Reservoir Characterization Group pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 17% and the Cameron Group declined 260 bps to 14%. Reservoir Characterization Group Second-quarter 2017 revenue of $1.8 billion increased 11% year-on-year primarily due to higher WesternGeco and Testing & Process revenue on projects in the Middle East & Asia Area.  Strong WesternGeco multiclient seismic license sales in the international markets also contributed to the increase. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 17% as increased revenue was offset by higher project costs in Testing & Process. 20 Drilling Group Second-quarter 2017 revenue of $2.1 billion increased 4% year-on-year primarily due to higher demand for directional drilling technologies on land in North America. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 594 bps to 14% primarily due to improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing. Production Group Second-quarter 2017 revenue of $2.5 billion increased 18% year-on-year with most of the revenue increase attributable to the accelerated land activity growth in North America that benefited the pressure pumping business. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 499 bps to 9% as a result of improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing. Cameron Group Second-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion declined 17% year-on-year, primarily due to a declining backlog for the long-cycle businesses of Drilling Systems and, to a lesser extent, OneSubsea. Pretax operating margin of 14% declined 260 bps primarily due the decline in high-margin Drilling Systems project volumes. Six Months 2017 Compared to Six Months 2016 (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income ($11 million in 2017; $12 million in 2016). (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income ($27 million in 2017; $26 million in 2016). (4) Charges and credits recorded are described in detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Certain prior period items have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Six-month 2017 revenue of $14.4 billion increased 5% year-on-year.  This included a full six months of activity from the acquired Cameron businesses versus one quarter of activity for the same period in 2016.  Excluding the impact of the Cameron Group, revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2017 declined 4% year-on-year. Six-month revenue for the Drilling Group declined 10%, primarily driven by the 9% decline in the international rig count combined with Schlumberger's decision in April 2016 to reduce its activities in Venezuela in order to align operations with cash collections. 21 These decreases were slightly mitigated by higher activity in US Land. Production Group revenue increased 4% as accelerated North America land  activity growth benefited the pressure pumping business. Reservoir Characterization Group revenue improved 2%. Six-month 2017 pretax operating margin increased 168 bps to 12%, as a result of improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity growth that benefited the Production and Drilling Groups.  As a result, Drilling Group pretax operating margin expanded 101 bps to 13% while the Production Group increased 66 bps to 7%.  Reservoir Characterization Group pretax operating margin declined 102 bps to 17% and the Cameron Group recorded a pretax operating margin of 13%. Reservoir Characterization Group Six-month 2017 revenue of $3.4 billion increased 2% year-on-year primarily due to higher WesternGeco and Testing & Process revenue on projects in the Middle East & Asia Area. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 102 bps to 17% due to reduced profitability in Testing & Process as project costs increased. Drilling Group Six-month 2017 revenue of $4.1 billion decreased 10% year-on-year primarily due to the drop in rig counts internationally and in offshore North America combined with pricing pressure.  Revenue also declined as a result of Schlumberger's decision in April 2016 to reduce its activities in Venezuela to align operations with cash collections. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 101 bps to 13% primarily due to improved profitability in North America land due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing; however this improvement in North America was partially offset by pricing pressure and activity declines internationally and the negative impact of reduced activity in Venezuela. Production Group Six-month 2017 revenue of $4.7 billion increased 4% year-on-year with most of the revenue increase attributable to the accelerated land activity growth in North America that benefited the pressure pumping product lines, which grew 15%.  Lower production levels in Ecuador negatively impacted Schlumberger Production Management projects, which partially offset the revenue increase. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 66 bps to 7% as a result of improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing.  This was offset by lower profitability in Schlumberger Production Management projects due to lower production in Ecuador. Cameron Group Cameron Group contributed six-month 2017 revenue of $2.5 billion.  Cameron Group revenue for the six months of 2016 only reflected only one quarter of revenue following the acquisition closing in April 2016.  Revenue in 2017 was impacted by a declining project backlog particularly for the long-cycle businesses of Drilling Systems and OneSubsea . Year-on-year pretax operating margin of 13% was 260 bps lower as a result of lower Drilling Systems project volumes. Interest and Other Income Interest & other income consisted of the following: 22 Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue , for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Research & engineering costs for the second quarter of 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2017 have decreased as compared to the same periods in 2016 by $61 million and $91 million, respectively, as a result of cost control measures, offset in part by the impact of the Cameron acquisition. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 590% as compared to 14.6% for the same period of 2016. The charges described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements increased the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 by 571 percentage points, as the majority of these charges were not tax-effective. Excluding the impact of these charges, the effective tax rate increased primarily as a result of the change in the geographic mix of earnings as Schlumberger generated a greater portion of its pretax earnings in North America during the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period last year . The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was 42.1% as compared to 14.2% for the same period of 2016. The charges described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements increased the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 by 24.7 percentage points, as the majority of these charges were not tax-effective. Excluding the impact of these charges, the effective tax rate increased primarily as a result of the change in the geographic mix of earnings as Schlumberger generated a greater portion of its pretax earnings in North America during the first six months of 2017 as compared to the same period last year. Charges and Credits Schlumberger recorded charges during the first and second quarters of 2017 which are fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a summary of the charges recorded during the first six months of 2017: 23 During the second quarter of 2016, Schlumberger recorded $2.573 billion of asset impairment and workforce reduction charges and $335 million of charges associated with the acqu isition of Cameron . These charges, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources Details of the components of liquidity as well as changes in liquidity follow: 24 Key liquidity events during the first six months of 2017 and 2016 included: The following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase programs: 25 Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value.  Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve.  Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices.  Schlumberger does not believe that these estimates are reasonably likely to materially change in the foreseeable future, however, adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments. In April 2016, Schlumberger announced that it would reduce its activity in Venezuela to align operations with cash collections as a result of insufficient payments received in recent quarters.  As of June 30, 2017 Schlumberger’s net accounts receivable balance in Venezuela was approximately $0.5 billion, which excludes the $0.2 billion carrying value of the promissory notes described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Schlumberger continues to experience payment delays from certain other customers as well, primarily a result of the impact of lower oil prices in the oil and gas industry.  In this regard, included in Receivables less allowance for doubtful accounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2017 is approximately $1.1 billion of receivables relating to Ecuador. Schlumberger’s receivables from its primary customers in Venezuela and Ecuador are not in dispute and Schlumberger has not historically had any material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable relating to these customers. During weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices, Schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables.  However, Schlumberger has not had material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable over the recent industry downturn.  Schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries.  As a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry, Schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable.  At June 30, 2017, only five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger’s net receivable balance, of which only two (the United States and Ecuador) accounted for greater than 10% of such receivables. On March 24, 2017, Schlumberger and Weatherford announced an agreement to create OneStim SM , a joint venture to deliver completions products and services for the development of unconventional resource plays in the United States and Canada land markets.  The joint venture will offer one of the broadest multistage completions portfolios in the market combined with one of the largest hydraulic fracturing fleets in the industry.  Schlumberger and Weatherford will have a 70%/30% ownership of the joint venture, respectively.  The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2017 and is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  Under the terms of the formation agreement, Schlumberger and Weatherford will contribute all their respective North America land hydraulic fracturing pressure pumping assets, multistage completions, and pump-down perforating businesses.  Schlumberger will also make a $535 million cash payment to Weatherford.  Schlumberger will manage the joint venture and consolidate it for financial reporting purposes. Cash flow from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017 decreased by approximately $1.3 billion.  This decrease was primarily driven by the delays in collecting certain receivables combined with the effects of the impact of the activity growth experienced during the second quarter of 2017, as well as expected future growth.

Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, Schlumberger’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that Schlumberger files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Schlumberger’s disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There was no change in Schlumberger’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Schlumberger’s internal control over financial reporting. 27 PART II.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities None. Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities On July 18, 2013, the Board approved a $10 billion share repurchase program for shares of Schlumberger common stock, to be completed at the latest by June 30, 2018.  This program was completed during May 2017.  On January 21, 2016, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock.  This new program took effect once the July 18, 2013 program was exhausted. Schlumberger’s common stock repurchase activity for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was as follows: In connection with the exercise of stock options under Schlumberger’s incentive compensation plans, Schlumberger routinely receives shares of its common stock from optionholders in consideration of the exercise price of the stock options. Schlumberger does not view these transactions as requiring disclosure under this Item as the number of shares of Schlumberger common stock received from optionholders is not material. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None . Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Our mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95 to this report. Item 5. Other Information. Schlumberger completed the wind down of its service operations in Iran during 2013. Prior to this, certain non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates (“NIOC”). 28 Schlumberger’s residual transactions or dealings with the government of Iran in the second quarter of 2017 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges. Certain non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger maintain depository accounts at the Dubai branch of Bank Saderat Iran (“Saderat”), and at Bank Tejarat (“Tejarat”) in Tehran and in Kish for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran and for the maintenance of such amounts previously received. One non-US subsidiary also maintains an account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes. Schlumberger anticipates that it will discontinue dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran. During the fourth quarter of 2016, a non-US subsidiary entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with NIOC relating to the non-disclosure of data required for the technical evaluation of an oilfield project.  In the first quarter of 2017, the Schlumberger subsidiary provided NIOC with written notice that it was terminating the MOU, effective March 11, 2017. The MOU did not involve the provision of services.  During the second quarter of 2017, and in furtherance of the termination of the MOU, the Schlumberger subsidiary had residual dealings with the NIOC consisting solely of the return of client data. 29 Item 6.

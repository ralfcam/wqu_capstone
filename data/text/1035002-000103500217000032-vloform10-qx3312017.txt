FINANCIAL STATEMENTS VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (millions of dollars, except par value) See Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 1 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) (unaudited) See Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (millions of dollars) (unaudited) See Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 3 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (millions of dollars) (unaudited) See Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 4 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basis of Presentation General As used in this report, the terms “Valero,” “we,” “us,” or “our” may refer to Valero Energy Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. These unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2017. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 has been derived from our audited financial statements as of that date. For further information, refer to our financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Reclassifications As of January 1, 2017, we revised our reportable segments to reflect a new reportable segment — VLP. The results of the VLP segment include the results of Valero Energy Partners LP (VLP), our majority-owned master limited partnership. Our prior period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 9 for additional information. Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Period In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-11, “Inventory (Topic 330),” to simplify the measurement of inventory measured using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods. The provisions of this ASU require the inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value rather than the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The provisions of this ASU are to be applied prospectively and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. Our adoption of this ASU effective January 1, 2017 did not affect our financial position or results of operations since the majority of our inventory is stated at last-in, first-out (LIFO). 5 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740),” to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The provisions of this ASU require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory immediately when the transfer occurs. These provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The provisions should be applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets that occurred before the adoption date. Our early adoption of this ASU using the modified retrospective method effective January 1, 2017 did not have a material affect on our financial position or results of operations. Adoption of this guidance more accurately reflects the economics of an intra-entity asset transfer when it occurs by eliminating the previous exception that prohibited the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset had been sold to an outside party. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810),” to provide guidance on how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The provisions should be applied on a retrospective basis to all relevant prior periods beginning with the fiscal year in which the VIE guidance was adopted with a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Our adoption of this ASU effective January 1, 2017 did not affect our financial position or results of operations. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805),” to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The provisions of this ASU provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business by clarifying the requirements related to inputs, processes, and outputs. These provisions are to be applied prospectively and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Our early adoption of this ASU effective January 1, 2017 did not have an affect on our financial position or results of operations. However, more of our future acquisitions may be accounted for as asset acquisitions. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods. We recently completed our evaluation of the provisions of this ASU and concluded that our adoption of the ASU will not materially change the amount or timing of revenues recognized by us, nor will it materially affect our financial position. The majority of our revenues are generated from the sale of refined petroleum products and ethanol. These revenues are largely based on the current spot (market) prices of the products sold, which represents consideration specifically allocable to the products being sold on a given day, and we recognize those revenues upon delivery and transfer of title to the products to our customers. The time at which delivery and transfer of title occurs is the point when our control of the products is transferred to our customers and when our performance obligation to our customers is fulfilled. We will adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2018, and 6 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) we expect to use the modified retrospective method of adoption as permitted by the ASU. Under that method, the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, and revenues reported in the periods prior to the date of adoption are not changed. During 2017, we are developing our revenue disclosures and enhancing our accounting systems. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10),” to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments regarding certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods. This ASU is to be applied using a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU effective January 1, 2018 will not affect our financial position or results of operations, but will result in revised disclosures. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We anticipate adopting the new standard on January 1, 2019 and we expect to use the modified retrospective method of adoption as permitted by the ASU. We recently completed our evaluation of the provisions of this standard, and a multi-disciplined implementation team has gained an understanding of the standard’s accounting and disclosure provisions. This team is developing enhanced contracting and lease evaluation processes and information systems to support such processes, as well as new and enhanced accounting systems to account for our leases and support the required disclosures. We continue to evaluate the effect that adopting this standard will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” The new standard requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. It also requires the other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. This ASU is to be applied retrospectively for income statement items and prospectively for any capitalized benefit costs. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2018 is not expected to materially affect our financial position or results of operations. 7 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Inventories consisted of the following (in millions): Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a valuation reserve of $766 million in order to state our inventories at market. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 , we recorded a change in our lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve that resulted in a net benefit to our results of operations of $293 million . As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the replacement cost (market value) of LIFO inventories exceeded their LIFO carrying amounts by $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion , respectively. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , our non-LIFO inventories accounted for $663 million and $641 million , respectively, of our total inventories. 8 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) There was no significant activity related to our debt during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 . Summary of Credit Facilities We had outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our credit facilities as follows (in millions): As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the weighted-average interest rate on the VLP Revolver was 2.3125 percent. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the weighted-average interest rate on the accounts receivable sales facility was 1.4805 percent and 1.3422 percent, respectively. Capital Leases In January 2017 , we recognized capital lease assets and related obligations of approximately $490 million for the lease of storage tanks located at three of our refineries. These lease agreements have initial terms of 10 years each with successive 10 -year automatic renewal terms. Environmental Matters We are involved, together with several other companies, in an environmental cleanup in the Village of Hartford, Illinois (the Village) and during 2015, one of these companies assumed the ongoing remediation in the Village pursuant to a federal court order. We had previously conducted an initial response in the Village, along with other companies, pursuant to an administrative order issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The parties involved in the initial response may have further claims among themselves for costs already incurred. We also continue to be engaged in site assessment and interim measures at the adjacent shutdown refinery site, which we acquired as part of an acquisition in 2005, and we are in litigation with other potentially responsible parties and the Illinois EPA relating to the remediation of the site. In each of these matters, we have various defenses, limitations, and potential rights for contribution from the other responsible parties. We have recorded a liability for our expected contribution obligations. However, because 9 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) of the unpredictable nature of these cleanups, the methodology for allocation of liabilities, and the State of Illinois’ failure to directly sue third parties responsible for historic contamination at the site, it is reasonably possible that we could incur a loss in a range of $0 to $200 million in excess of the amount of our accrual to ultimately resolve these matters. Factors underlying this estimated range are expected to change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate. Litigation Matters We are party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We have not recorded a loss contingency liability with respect to some of these matters because we have determined that it is remote that a loss has been incurred. For other matters, we have recorded a loss contingency liability where we have determined that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable. These loss contingency liabilities are not material to our financial position. We re-evaluate and update our loss contingency liabilities as matters progress over time, and we believe that any changes to the recorded liabilities will not be material to our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Reconciliation of Balances The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of equity attributable to our stockholders, equity attributable to noncontrolling interests, and total equity (in millions): ___________________________ 10 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Share Activity There was no significant share activity during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 . Common Stock Dividends On May 3, 2017 , our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per common share payable on June 7, 2017 to holders of record at the close of business on May 17, 2017 . Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, net of tax, were as follows (in millions): Overview In the normal course of business, we have financial interests in certain entities that have been determined to be VIEs. We consolidate a VIE when we have a variable interest in an entity for which we are the primary beneficiary such that we have (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In order to make this determination, we evaluated our contractual arrangements with the VIEs, including arrangements for the use of assets, purchases of products and services, debt, equity, or management of operating activities. Our significant VIE’s include: 11 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The VIEs’ assets can only be used to settle their own obligations and the VIEs’ creditors have no recourse to our assets. We do not provide financial guarantees to our VIEs. Although we have provided credit facilities to the VIEs in support of their construction or acquisition activities, these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are impacted by our consolidated VIEs’ performance, net of intercompany eliminations, to the extent of our ownership interest in each VIE. The following tables present summarized balance sheet information for the significant assets and liabilities of our VIEs, which are included in our balance sheets (in millions). 12 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The components of net periodic benefit cost related to our defined benefit plans were as follows (in millions): Our anticipated contributions to our pension and other post retirement benefit plans during 2017 have not changed from amounts previously disclosed in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. We contributed $7 million and $8 million , respectively, to our pension plans and $5 million and $4 million , respectively, to our other postretirement benefit plans during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 . 13 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Earnings per common share were computed as follows (dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts): Participating securities include restricted stock and performance awards granted under our 2011 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan. 14 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Effective January 1, 2017, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — VLP. The results of the VLP segment, which include the results of our majority-owned master limited partnership referred to by the same name, were transferred from the refining segment. Our prior period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. As a result, we have three reportable segments as follows: Operations that are not included in any of the reportable segments are included in the corporate category. Our reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are managed separately as each business requires unique technologies and marketing strategies. Performance is evaluated based on segment operating income, which includes revenues and expenses that are directly attributable to management of the respective segment. Intersegment sales are generally derived from transactions made at prevailing market rates. 15 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table reflects activity related to our reportable segments (in millions): ___________________________ 16 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Total assets by reportable segment were as follows (in millions): In order to determine net cash provided by operating activities, net income is adjusted by, among other things, changes in current assets and current liabilities as follows (in millions): Noncash investing and financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 included the recognition of a capital lease asset and related obligation associated with an agreement for storage tanks near three of our refineries. This noncash transaction is further described in Note 3 . There were no significant noncash investing or financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016 . Cash flows related to interest and income taxes were as follows (in millions): 17 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Recurring Fair Value Measurements The tables below present information (in millions) about our assets and liabilities recognized at their fair values in our balance sheets categorized according to the fair value hierarchy of the inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty, including any related cash collateral assets or obligations as shown below; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are presented in the tables below on a gross basis. We have no derivative contracts that are subject to master netting arrangements that are reflected gross on the balance sheet. 18 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A description of our assets and liabilities recognized at fair value along with the valuation methods and inputs we used to develop their fair value measurements are as follows: 19 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) There were no transfers between levels for assets and liabilities held as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There was no activity during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 related to the fair value amounts categorized in Level 3 as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements There were no assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . 20 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Other Financial Instruments Financial instruments that we recognize in our balance sheets at their carrying amounts are shown in the table below along with their associated fair values (in millions): The methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments are as follows: We are exposed to market risks primarily related to the volatility in the price of commodities, and foreign currency exchange rates, and the price of credits needed to comply with various government and regulatory programs. We enter into derivative instruments to manage some of these risks, including derivative instruments related to the various commodities we purchase or produce, and foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts, as described below under “Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk.” These derivative instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values (see Note 11 ), as summarized below under “Fair Values of Derivative Instruments,” with changes in fair value recognized currently in income. The effect of these derivative instruments on our income is summarized below under “Effect of Derivative Instruments on Income.” Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, and options. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. 21 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) To manage commodity price risk, we use economic hedges, which are not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, and we use fair value and cash flow hedges from time to time. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes. Our objectives for entering into hedges or trading derivatives are described below. As of March 31, 2017 , we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were used as economic hedges, as well as commodity derivative instruments related to the physical purchase of corn at a fixed price. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels, except those identified as corn contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels and soybean oil contracts that are presented in thousands of pounds). 22 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of March 31, 2017 , we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into for trading purposes. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes represent thousands of barrels, except those identified as corn contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels). We had no commodity derivative contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 or during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 that were designated as fair value or cash flow hedges. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the local (functional) currencies of those operations. To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we use foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and therefore are classified as economic hedges. As of March 31, 2017 , we had forward contracts to purchase $350 million of U.S. dollars. These commitments matured on or before April 30, 2017 . Environmental Compliance Program Price Risk We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. Certain of these programs require us to blend biofuels into the products we produce, and we are subject to such programs in most of the countries in which we operate. These countries set annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels that must be blended into the motor fuels consumed in these countries. As a producer of motor fuels from petroleum, we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the applicable quota. To the degree we are unable to blend at the applicable rate, we must purchase biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.). We are exposed to the volatility in the 23 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) market price of these credits, and we manage that risk by purchasing biofuel credits when prices are deemed favorable. The cost of meeting our obligations under these compliance programs was $146 million and $161 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. These amounts are reflected in cost of sales. We are subject to additional requirements under greenhouse gas (GHG) emission programs, including the cap-and-trade systems, as discussed in Note 11 . Under these cap-and-trade systems, we purchase various GHG emission credits available on the open market. Therefore, we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of these credits. The cost to implement certain provisions of the cap-and-trade systems are significant; however, we recovered the majority of these costs from our customers for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 and expect to continue to recover the majority of these costs in the future. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 , the net cost of meeting our obligations under these compliance programs was immaterial. Fair Values of Derivative Instruments The following tables provide information about the fair values of our derivative instruments as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in millions) and the line items in the balance sheets in which the fair values are reflected. See Note 11 for additional information related to the fair values of our derivative instruments. As indicated in Note 11 , we net fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements, including cash collateral assets and obligations. The tables below, however, are presented on a gross asset and gross liability basis, which results in the reflection of certain assets in liability accounts and certain liabilities in asset accounts. 24 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Market Risk Our price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments into the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, which is the risk that future changes in market conditions may make an instrument less valuable. We closely monitor and manage our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. Market risks are monitored by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy. We do not require any collateral or other security to support derivative instruments into which we enter. We also do not have any derivative instruments that require us to maintain a minimum investment-grade credit rating. Effect of Derivative Instruments on Income The following tables provide information about the gain or loss recognized in income on our derivative instruments and the income statement line items in which such gains and losses are reflected (in millions). 25 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This Form 10-Q, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK , ” includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “projection,” “predict,” “budget,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “target,” “could,” “should,” “may,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding: We based our forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following: 26 Table of Contents Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. This Form 10-Q includes references to financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, gross margin, and adjusted operating income. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between periods. See the accompanying financial tables in “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” and note (c) to the accompanying tables for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Also in note (c), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information. 27 Table of Contents OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK Overview We reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $305 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $495 million in the first quarter of 2016 , which represents a decrease of $190 million . This decrease is primarily due to lower operating income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 (net of the resulting decrease of $105 million in income tax expense between the periods). Operating income was $ 537 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $ 829 million in the first quarter of 2016 , which represents a decrease of $ 292 million . Operating income and net income attributable to Valero stockholders in the first quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by a noncash benefit from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment. By excluding that benefit from both amounts, adjusted operating income was $ 536 million and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $ 283 million for the first quarter of 2016 . Compared to these adjusted amounts, operating income and net income attributable to Valero stockholders in the first quarter of 2017 increased by $1 million and $22 million, respectively. The $1 million increase in adjusted operating income is due primarily to the following: Additional details and analysis of the changes in operating income and adjusted operating income for our business segments and other components of net income and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this Overview to their most comparable measures reported under U.S. GAAP, are provided below under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” beginning on page 30. Effective January 1, 2017 , we revised our reportable segments to reflect a new reportable segment — VLP. The results of operations of the VLP segment were previously included in the refining segment. Our prior period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 9 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional segment information. 28 Table of Contents Outlook In the second quarter of 2017 , we expect margins to improve as demand follows typical seasonal patterns. Below are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the second quarter of 2017 : 29 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations. In addition, these tables include financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and represent non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and include adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, adjusted operating income, and gross margin. In note (c) to these tables, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information. Effective January 1, 2017, we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages and allocates resources to our business. Accordingly, we created a new reportable segment — VLP. The results of the VLP segment, which include the results of our majority-owned master limited partnership referred to by the same name, were transferred from the refining segment. Our prior period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. The narrative following these tables provides an analysis of our results of operations. Financial Highlights By Segment and Total Company (millions of dollars) 30 Table of Contents Financial Highlights By Segment and Total Company (continued) (millions of dollars) ______________ See note references on pages 35 and 36 . 31 Table of Contents Refining Segment Operating Highlights (millions of dollars, except per barrel amounts) _______________ See note references on pages 35 and 36 . 32 Table of Contents Ethanol Segment Operating Highlights (millions of dollars, except per gallon amounts) VLP Segment Operating Highlights (millions of dollars, except per barrel amounts) _______________ See note references on pages 35 and 36 . 33 Table of Contents Average Market Reference Prices and Differentials (dollars per barrel, except as noted) _______________ See note references on page 36 . 34 Table of Contents The following notes relate to references on pages 30 through 34. We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes the utility of these measures. Non-GAAP measures are as follows: 35 Table of Contents 36 Table of Contents Total Company, Corporate, and Other Operating revenues increased $ 6.1 billion and cost of sales increased $ 5.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 due primarily to increases in refined petroleum product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively, associated with our refining segment, reflecting improved product margins of $137 million. This $137 million improvement was more than offset by the effect from the $ 293 million benefit in the first quarter of 2016 from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and increases in operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense of $ 87 million , $ 34 million , and $ 15 million , respectively, resulting in a decrease in operating income of $292 million . This decrease in operating income is the primary driver of the $ 190 million decrease in net income attributable to Valero stockholders from $495 million in the first quarter of 2016 to $305 million in the first quarter of 2017 . Excluding the $293 million benefit from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, first quarter 2016 adjusted operating income was $536 million . Compared to this adjusted amount, operating income increased by $1 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $537 million , with improved product margins being almost fully offset by the increased costs discussed above. Details regarding changes in product margins, operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense are discussed by segment in the individual segment analysis below. General and administrative expenses increased $ 34 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to an increase in environmental reserves. Income tax expense decreased $105 million from the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. The effective tax rates of 26 percent in the first quarter of 2017 and 30 percent in the first quarter of 2016 are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent because income from our international operations is taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2017 was also lower than the rate in the first quarter of 2016 due to a reduction in the statutory tax rate in Quebec and from the favorable resolution of several state income tax audits. Refining Segment Results Refining segment operating revenues increased $6.0 billion and cost of sales increased $5.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to an increase in refined petroleum product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively, reflecting improved product margins (refining gross margin) of $72 million . This $72 million improvement was more than offset by the effect from the $ 263 million benefit in the first quarter of 2016 from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and an increase in operating expenses of $ 77 million , resulting in a decrease in operating income of $ 268 million . Excluding the $ 263 million benefit from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, first quarter 2016 adjusted operating income for the refining segment was $ 652 million . Compared to this adjusted amount, operating income decreased by $ 5 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $ 647 million , with the $72 million increase in refining gross margin being more than offset by the $ 77 million increase in operating expenses. Refining gross margin increased $72 million (a $0.48 per barrel increase) in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 , primarily due to the following: 37 Table of Contents increase of $ 3.20 per barrel. Another example is the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was $13.99 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $11.03 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 , representing a favorable increase of $2.96 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in distillate margins in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 had a favorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $244 million. The increase of $77 million in refining segment operating expenses was primarily due to a $38 million increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices ($ 2.95 per MMBtu in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $ 1.93 per MMBtu in the first quarter of 2016 ) and a $27 million increase in costs associated with maintenance activities in the first quarter of 2017 . Ethanol Segment Results Ethanol segment operating revenues increased $117 million and cost of sales increased $79 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to an increase in ethanol prices and corn costs, respectively, reflecting improved product margins (ethanol gross margin) of $38 million . This $38 million improvement was more than offset by the effect from the $ 30 million benefit in the first quarter of 2016 from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and increases in operating expenses and depreciation and amortization expense of $ 10 million and $ 15 million , respectively, resulting in a decrease in operating income of $ 17 million . Excluding the $ 30 million benefit from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, first quarter 2016 adjusted operating income for the ethanol segment was $ 9 million . Compared to this adjusted amount, operating income increased by $ 13 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $ 22 million , with the increase in ethanol gross margin being partially offset by the $ 10 million increase in operating expenses and the $ 15 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. 38 Table of Contents The increase in ethanol segment gross margin of $38 million (or $0.08 per gallon) was primarily due to higher ethanol prices. Ethanol prices were higher in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 driven by increased ethanol demand. For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was $1.58 per gallon in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $1.45 per gallon in the first quarter of 2016 . We estimate that the increase in the price of ethanol per gallon during the first quarter of 2017 had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $35 million. The increase of $ 10 million in ethanol segment operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices ($ 2.95 per MMBtu in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $ 1.93 per MMBtu in the first quarter of 2016 ). The increase of $ 15 million in ethanol segment depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to write-offs for assets that were idled in the first quarter of 2017 . VLP Segment Results VLP segment operating revenues increased $ 27 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to incremental revenues generated from transportation and terminaling services provided to the refining segment associated with businesses and assets acquired after the first quarter of 2016 , as discussed below. This $ 27 million increase in revenues resulted in an increase in operating income of $ 27 million . VLP segment operating revenues increased $ 27 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 , primarily due to the following: 39 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Our operations generated $988 million of cash in the first three months of 2017 , driven primarily by net income of $321 million , noncash charges to income of $496 million , and a positive change in working capital of $151 million . Noncash charges primarily include $500 million of depreciation and amortization expense. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital is further detailed in Note 10 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This source of cash mainly resulted from: The $988 million of cash generated by our operations, along with (i) net proceeds of $35 million from VLP’s sale of common units representing limited partner interests to the public and (ii) $353 million from available cash on hand, were used mainly to: Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Our operations generated $640 million of cash in the first three months of 2016 , driven primarily by net income of $513 million and net noncash charges to income of $313 million . Noncash charges include $485 million of depreciation and amortization expense and $121 million of deferred income tax expense, partially offset by a benefit of $293 million from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment. See “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for further discussion of our operations. However, the change in our working capital in the first three months of 2016 had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of $177 million as shown in Note 10 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This use of cash mainly resulted from: The $640 million of cash generated by our operations, along with $336 million from our total cash on hand, were used mainly to: Capital Investments For 2017 , we expect to incur approximately $2.7 billion for capital investments, including capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for stay-in-business capital and $1.1 billion for growth strategies, 40 Table of Contents including our continued investment in Diamond Pipeline LLC (Diamond Pipeline) described below. This capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. We hold equity-method investments in joint ventures and we invest in these joint ventures or enter into new joint venture arrangements to enhance our operations. We have a 50 percent interest in Diamond Pipeline, which was formed by Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (Plains) to construct and operate a 440-mile, 20-inch crude oil pipeline expected to provide capacity of up to 200,000 barrels per day of domestic sweet crude oil from the Plains’ Cushing, Oklahoma terminal to our Memphis Refinery, with the ability to connect into the Capline Pipeline. The pipeline is expected to be completed in 2017 for an estimated cost of $925 million. We have made cumulative cash contributions of $252 million in Diamond Pipeline and expect to continue making contributions as the construction progresses. Contractual Obligations As of March 31, 2017 , our contractual obligations included debt, capital lease obligations, operating leases, purchase obligations, and other long-term liabilities. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business with respect to these contractual obligations during the three months ended March 31, 2017 . However, in the ordinary course of business, we recognized capital lease assets and related obligations of approximately $490 million each related to the lease of storage tanks located at three of our refineries. These lease agreements have initial terms of 10 years each with successive 10 -year automatic renewal terms. Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. All of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings. 41 Table of Contents Summary of Credit Facilities We had outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our credit facilities as follows (in millions): Letters of credit issued as of March 31, 2017 expire at various times in 2017 through 2018. Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources Stock Purchase Program On September 21, 2016 , our board of directors authorized our purchase of up to an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock (the 2016 program) with no expiration date. This authorization was in addition to the remaining amount available under a $2.5 billion program authorized on July 13, 2015 (the 2015 program). During the first quarter of 2017, we completed our purchases under the 2015 program. As of March 31, 2017 , we had approximately $2.2 billion remaining available under the 2016 program. We have no obligation to make purchases under this program. Pension Plan Funding We plan to contribute approximately $28 million to our pension plans and $19 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2017 . Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future as previously discussed above in “OUTLOOK.” In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters. Tax Matters The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal income tax returns from 2010 through 2015, and we have received Revenue Agent Reports (RARs) in connection with the 2010 and 2011 audit. We are contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the RARs and continue to 42 Table of Contents make progress in resolving certain of these matters with the IRS. We believe that the ultimate settlement of these audits will not be material to our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Cash Held by Our International Subsidiaries We operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of March 31, 2017 , $2.5 billion of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries. Concentration of Customers Our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. Sources of Liquidity We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As of March 31, 2017 , there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies since the date our annual report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2016 was filed. 43 Table of Contents COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined petroleum products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to manage the volatility of: We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our price risk activities. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): See Note 12 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of March 31, 2017 . 44 Table of Contents COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and GHG emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. To manage these risks, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. As of March 31, 2017 , there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. See Note 12 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs. INTEREST RATE RISK The following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. ________________________ FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK As of March 31, 2017 , we had commitments to purchase $350 million of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as all of them matured on or before April 30, 2017 . 45 Table of Contents Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in             Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2017 . There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 46 Table of Contents PART II – OTHER INFORMATION The information below describes new proceedings or material developments in proceedings that we previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Litigation We incorporate by reference into this Item our disclosures made in Part I, Item 1 of this report included in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Litigation Matters.” Environmental Enforcement Matters While it is not possible to predict the outcome of the following environmental proceedings, if any one or more of them were decided against us, we believe that there would be no material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. We are reporting these proceedings to comply with SEC regulations, which require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or protecting the environment if we reasonably believe that such proceedings will result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. U.S. EPA . In our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported that certain of our refineries had received one or more letters or demands from the Department of Justice (DOJ), on behalf of the U.S. EPA, concerning proposed stipulated penalties under an existing consent decree that we reasonably believed would result in penalties in excess of $100,000. We have resolved these matters with the DOJ and U.S. EPA. U.S. EPA (Fuels). On February 28, 2017, we received a Notice of Violation from the U.S. EPA related to alleged violations from its Mobile Source Inspection of 2015, which we believe will result in penalties in excess of $100,000. We are working with the U.S. EPA to resolve this matter. U.S. EPA (Meraux Refinery). In our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported that in November 2016, we received from the U.S. EPA a draft Consent Agreement and Final Order (CAFO) related to a previous Risk Management Plan inspection at our Meraux Refinery, which included proposed penalties of $182,000. We have finalized the CAFO and resolved this matter with the U.S. EPA. Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) (Benicia Refinery). We currently have multiple outstanding Violation Notices (VNs) issued by the BAAQMD from 2013 to the present. These VNs are for alleged reporting violations and excess emissions at our Benicia Refinery and asphalt plant. On April 19, 2017, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the BAAQMD to resolve various outstanding VNs and we continue to work with the BAAQMD to resolve the remaining VNs. Environment Canada (EC) (Quebec Refinery). In our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported that we were involved in a legal proceeding initiated by the EC alleging breaches of certain conditions at our Quebec Refinery of a directive issued under the Canadian Fisheries Act. We have resolved this matter with the EC. 47 Table of Contents There have been no changes from the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 . ______________________ 48 Table of Contents ______________ 49 Table of Contents SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
